experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .
  experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california
institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is
trip position .

transition studies and skin friction measurements on
an insulated flat plate at a mach number of 5.8 .
  an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .
  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-
layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a
uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .
  the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was
investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10
regardless of the amount of air injected .
  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
  direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds
numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for
incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective
reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 .

constant temperature can be made the same by a proper
modification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate .
this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate
can be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate by
a series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the
application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic
heating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog
wing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by

formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix
approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a

components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .

pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good

in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow
carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general
electric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity in
axisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable
experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by
rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to
the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of
the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference
infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that
the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent
boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of
this assumption and of the transformations was established for several

theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated

  the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a
dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibrium .
  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
made .
  for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are
considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .
a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is
involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .
  it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by
a simple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .

inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies .
  at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much
larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy
contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight
direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many
times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly
analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave
found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a
flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this
similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution
is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a
hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .
  energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,
where for a two-dimensional body and for a
body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some
distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details
of the nose geometry .
  by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures
generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures
induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the
corresponding distance is given by .  (here
is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge
thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are
replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous
interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt-
nosed slender body only for relatively low values of .
however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is

a simple model study of transient temperature and thermal
stress distribution due to aerodynamic heating .
  the present work is concerned with the determination of
transient temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intended
to simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the built-
up variety subjected to aerodynamic heating .
  the first case considered is that of convective heat transfer
into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the
effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing
thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .
numerical results are presented for the transient temperature
differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first
increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the
period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of
the aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information is
presented .
  the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with
convective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges .  numerical
results are presented for transient temperature differentials for a
wide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an
environment temperature variation as described above .
corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are
determined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam
of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for
one case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures and
stresses in such a beam is described, and results are presented
which indicate good agreement with corresponding theoretical
results .

the dynamic motion of a missile descending through
the atmosphere .
  a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,
the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through
the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a
set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a
set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion
of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation
allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner
analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass
system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring
constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be
solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an
additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete
oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function
of the maximum angle of attack at that time .
  this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a
missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant
speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .

the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics .
  the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting
fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written
down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to
aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable
significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .
dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions
of flight in the atmosphere .
  some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-
gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow
with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in
constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is
characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these
are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to
the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel .
  it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from
magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to
justify the considerable research and engineering development
that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems
are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact
with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,
and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .

constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .
in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant
temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .

  the purpose of this paper is to present a method of calculation
devised to yield all the important information on the symmetric
inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnation point region of a blunt
body .  the problem is the same as that considered by hayes
who used a slightly different approach .  it is demonstrated that
hayes' results are valid in the stagnation point region and can
hence be considered a basis for constructing less restricted
solutions .
  equations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment
distance, and vorticity .  the values of shock detachment
distance and body pressure coefficient are compared with
experimental data for spheres .  the pressure comparison shows that
the results of hayes and the theory presented herein represent a
better approximation than the newtonian impact theory for
hypersonic mach numbers .

supersonic flow around blunt bodies .
the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be
useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part
of bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practice
to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the
wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  this
procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend
on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian
analysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer
stability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,
therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic
missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate
aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar
flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test
result to the design condition .

a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .
  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in
conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a
means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .

on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface .
  this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream
indicates the important factors determining the pressure
distribution on the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave pattern
suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived
from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves
reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in
airfoil surface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected mach
waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil
leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure
distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can
be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to
give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil .
  an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure
distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good
agreement with experiment .

  tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of

boundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds .  the effects of
cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97,
smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream
turbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-element
roughnesses at fixed axial location .  transition data were obtained
optically by means of a magnified-schlieren system .  the results,
for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1)
transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface
cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream
turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling
depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness
respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and
roughness decrease with increasing mach number .

the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propeller
on engine and wing vibration modes .
  in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take
into account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence,
it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this
flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine
mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered
from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility .
if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it
vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due
to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce
propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness
tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the
propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the
cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to
investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself
is a rigid disc .
  the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly
with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine
vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a
model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever
beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of
an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate
an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists
of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking
what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are
obtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller may
materially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies .

tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 .
there is, at present, considerable interest in the
characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a
heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is
contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from
mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in
drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone
or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although
the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes
are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a
total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat-
transfer standpoint .
  the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the
aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic
body .
the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid
past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in
the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently
been investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is
generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a
body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction
parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi-
incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical
significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it
provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic
equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved
are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .

analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .
  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-
aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the
orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary
conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a
network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships
in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of
square matrices composed independently for the different
transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary
conditions .
  comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and
electric-analog solutions are favorable .

temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible
laminar boundary layer with arbitrary distribution
of surface temperature .
  an analysis is presented which enables the temperature
profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be
calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially
symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary
analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is
applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the
numerical results given herein have been computed for air .
the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant
surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco .
on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present
theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations
accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions
up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent
for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher
mach numbers .
  a particular effort has been made to present the results, which
are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used
readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point
of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic
distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is
necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be
approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final
equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the
work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends
entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface-
temperature distribution by a polynomial .
  an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the
principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown
that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer
coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative
heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the
customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown
to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface
temperature .  in the particular example considered, a
conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields
completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the
possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given .
in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal
equations developed are collected and summarized in the section
entitled /practical use of results ./

speed including camber deflections, and comparison
with experimental results .
  a method which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers is
described for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber in
their deflection modes .  the normal coupled vibration modes of the wing
are used to derive the equations of motion .  chord deflections of the
vibration modes are approximated by polynomials .  the wing may have a
control surface and may carry external stores although no aerodynamic
forces on the stores are presented .  the aerodynamic forces that are
assumed to be acting on the wing are obtained from piston theory and
also from a quasi-steady form of a theory for two-dimensional steady
flow .  airfoil shape and thickness effects are taken account of in the
analysis .
  the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wings
which had been previously tested at mach numbers of 1.3 to 3.0 .
comparison of the calculations and experiment is made for flat-plate 60
and 45 delta wings and also for an untapered 45 sweptback wing .

transition reynolds numbers of separated flows at
supersonic speeds .
  experimental research has been conducted on the effects of wall
cooling, mach number, and unit reynolds
number on the transition reynolds
number of cylindrical separated boundary
layers on an ogive-cylinder model .
results were obtained from pressure and temperature measurements and
shadowgraph observations .  the maximum
scope of measurements encompassed
mach numbers between 2.06 and 4.24, reynolds numbers (based on length of
separation) between 60,000 and 400,000,
and ratios of wall temperature to
adiabatic wall temperature between 0.35 and 1.0 .
within the range of the
present tests, the transition reynolds number was observed to decrease
with increasing wall cooling, increase with increasing mach number, and
increase with increasing unit reynolds number .  the wall-cooling effect
was found to be four times as great when the attached boundary layer
upstream of separation was cooled in conjunction with cooling of the
separated boundary layer as when only the separated boundary layer was
cooled .  wall cooling of both the
attached and separated flow regions also
caused, in some cases, reattachment in the otherwise separated region .
cavity resonance present in the separated region for some model
configurations was accompanied by a large decrease in transition reynolds
number at the lower test mach numbers .

method for calculation of compressible laminar boundary
layer characteristics in axial pressure gradient with
zero heat transfer .
  the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degree
velocity profiles for determining
the characteristics of the compressible
laminar boundary layer over an adiabatic
wall in the presence of an axial
pressure gradient .  it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity and
that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .
a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of
the boundary-layer characteristics for any given free-stream mach number
and given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layer
is obtained .  numerical examples indicate that this solution will in
practice lead to results of satisfactory
accuracy, including the critical
reynolds number for stability .  for the special purpose of calculating
the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, a
short and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocity
profile, is derived .  the numerical example given here indicates that
this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results .
for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shown
that the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profiles
leads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynolds
number .

an analysis of the applicability of the hypersonic
similarity law to the study of the flow about bodies
of revolution at zero angle of attack .
  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has been
investigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making
these comparisons, particular
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this
investigation, pressure distributions
determined by the method of
characteristics for ogive cylinders for
values of mach numbers and fineness
ratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .
pressures on various cones
and on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .
  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonic
similarity law is applicable over a
wider range of values of mach numbers
and fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made in
the derivation .  this is significant since within the range of
applicability of the law a single pressure
distribution exists for all similarly
shaped bodies for which the ratio of
free-stream mach number to fineness
ratio is constant .  charts are presented
for rapid determination of
pressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of mach
number and fineness ratio within defined limits .

applicability of the hypersonic similarity rule to

  the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to include
the effects of flow rotation .  it is
found that the theoretical pressure
distributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic
similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .
  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive
cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations
is investigated .  it is found that
the influence of the rotation term on
pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity
parameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .
although the error in
drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the
error is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .
  charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressure
distributions for rotational flow over
ogive cylinders for all values of
the similarity parameter between 0.5 and

pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-angle
cones at mach number 3.86 and angles of attack to

  measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modified
newtonian theory .  deviations as large as 14 percent of the stagnation
pressure behind a normal shock are found .
by combining empirical results
for cylinders normal to the flow with
newtonian concepts, a method of
calculating pressures on cones at high angles
of attack is developed .
calculations by this method differ from the
experimental results on sharp cones
by only 2 percent of the stagnation
pressure behind a normal shock .  for
blunted cones, additional deviations
up to 8 percent are noted near the
nose .
  schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharp
of attack .  detachment of the shock
appears to be associated with the
attainment of sonic speed immediately
behind the shock .
  an orifice size effect is found which can increase the indicated
pressure above the true value, if
the orifice width is greater than
one-tenth the local radius of curvature .

  the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundary
layer for two-dimensional steady-state compressible flow have been
transformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method of
pohlhausen, falkner, and skan .  the ordinary equations include
parameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient in

ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative values
found at the laminar separation points .  three rates of flow through
the porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case where
the flow rate is 0) .  five temperature ratios (stream temperature
divided by wall temperature) were used ..  the uncooled and unheated
case (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios of

for flow over a flat plate when the magnetic field is fixed relative to
the plate or to the fluid .  the
equations are integrated numerically for

  it is concluded that the skin friction and the heat-transfer rate are
reduced when the transverse magnetic

similar solutions for the compressible laminar boundary
layer with heat transfer and pressure gradient .
  stewartson's transformation is applied to the laminar compressible
boundary-layer equations and the
requirement of similarity is introduced,
resulting in a set of ordinary nonlinear differential equations
previously quoted by stewartson, but unsolved .  the requirements of the
system are ..  prandtl number of 1.0, linear viscosity-temperature
relation across the boundary layer, an
isothermal surface, and the particular
distributions of free-stream velocity
consistent with similar solutions .
this system admits axial pressure
gradients of arbitrary magnitude, heat
flux normal to the surface, and arbitrary mach numbers .
  the system of differential equations is transformed to an integral
system, with the velocity ratio as
the independent variable .  for this
system, solutions are found for pressure gradients varying from that
causing separation to the infinitely favorable gradient and for wall
temperatures from absolute zero to twice the free-stream stagnation
temperature .  some solutions for separated flows are also presented .
  for favorable pressure gradients, the solutions are unique .  for
adverse pressure gradients, where the solutions are not unique, two
solutions of the infinite family of possible solutions are identified as
essentially viscid at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the
remainder essentially inviscid .  for
the case of favorable pressure gradients
with heated walls, the velocity within
a portion of the boundary layer is
shown to exceed the local external velocity .
the variation of a reynolds
analogy parameter, which indicates the ratio of skin friction to heat
transfer, is from zero to 7.4 for a surface of temperature twice the
free-stream stagnation temperature, and from zero to 2.8 for a surface
held at absolute zero where the value 2 applies to a flat plate .

some effects of joint conductivity on the temperature

  temperatures and thermal stresses in typical skin-stiffener
combinations of winglike structures subjected to aerodynamic heating have
been obtained with the aid of an electronic differential analyzer .
variations were made in an aerodynamic
heat-transfer parameter, in a joint
conductivity parameter, and in the ratio
of skin width to skin thickness .
the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that
decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior
and the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stress
ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter
decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the
peak skin stress ratios somewhat,
but greatly increases the peak
stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin
thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress
ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios .

boundary layer behind shock or thin expansion wave
moving into stationary fluid .
  the boundary layer behind a shock or thin expansion wave advancing
into a stationary fluid has been determined .  laminar and turbulent
boundary layers were considered .  the wall surface temperature behind
the wave was also investigated .  the assumption of a thin expansion
wave is valid for weak expansions but becomes progressively less
accurate for strong expansion waves .
  the laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numerical
integration except for the weak wave case,
which can be solved analytically .
integral (karman-pohlhausen type)
solutions were also obtained to provide
a guide for determining expressions
which accurately represent the
numerical data .  analytical expressions
for various boundary-layer parameters
are presented which agree with the
numerical integrations within 1 percent .
  the turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integral
methods similar to those employed for the
solution of turbulent compressible
flow over a semi-infinite flat plate .
the fluid velocity, relative to
the wall, was assumed to have a
seventh-power profile .  the blasius
equation, relating turbulent skin friction
and boundary-layer thickness, was
utilized in a form which accounted for compressibility .
  consideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wall
surface temperature, behind the wave,
to be determined .  the wall
thickness was assumed to be greater than the
wall thermal-boundary-layer
thickness .  it was found that the wall
temperature was uniform (as a
function of distance behind the wave)
for the laminar-boundary-layer case
but varied with distance for the turbulent-boundary-layer case .

investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary
layer in a compressible fluid .
  in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar
flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations .
the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .
  part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical
theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small
velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great
detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances
have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous
solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first
approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is
greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and
the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the
incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the
coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .
  part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers .
the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown
that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface
has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .
  a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the
gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the
rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid .
if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the
main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) .

  the ratio of the root-mean-square fluctuating wall pressure to the
free-stream dynamic pressure is presented as a function of reynolds
number and mach number .  the longitudinal
component of the turbulent-velocity
fluctuations was measured, and the turbulence-intensity profiles are
presented for the wing and forward-fuselage section .
  in general, the results are in agreement with wind-tunnel
measurements which have been reported in the literature .  for example, the
variation of (is the root mean square of the wall-pressure
fluctuation, and q is the free-stream dynamic pressure) with reynolds
number was found to be essentially constant for the forward
fuselage-section boundary layer, while variations at the wing station were
probably unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which was
large compared with the boundary-layer thickness .

a comparative analysis of the performance of long range
hypervelocity vehicles .
  long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their
motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in
unpowered flight .  powered flight is
analyzed for an idealized propulsion
system which rather closely approaches
present-day rocket motors .
unpowered flight is characterized by a return
to earth along a ballistic, skip,
or glide trajectory .  only those
trajectories are treated which yield the
maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight .
aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner
similar to that employed previously
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is
considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .
  the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the
several types studied in the sense
that it generally requires the highest
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range .
this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat
transfer to the re-entry body through
the artifice of increasing pressure
drag in relation to friction drag - that
is, by using a blunt body .  thus
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .
  the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood
of and greater than 4 is far superior
to the ballistic vehicle in ability
to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage
that this heat can in the main be radiated
back to the atmosphere .
consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .
  the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in
converting velocity into range .  at
lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to
be about equal to comparable ballistic
vehicles while at lift-drag ratios

an analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precession
instability .
  an analytical investigation is made of a precession-type instability
which can occur in a flexibly supported aircraft-engine-propeller
combination .  by means of an idealized
mathematical model which is comprised
of a rigid power-plant system flexibly
mounted in pitch and yaw to a fixed
backup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability are
determined .  the paper also examines the sensitivity of the stability
boundaries to changes in such parameters
as stiffness, damping, and
asymmetries in the engine mount, propeller
speed, airspeed, mach number,
propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is found
to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system .
  with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability
boundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel
tests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoretical
results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends
as observed experimentally,. however,
for a given set of conditions
calculated airspeeds for neutral stability
are consistently lower than the
measured values .  evidently, this result is due to the fact that wing
response tends to add damping to the system .

effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layer
transition .
  an investigation was made to determine the combined effects of
surface cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish on
boundary-layer transition .  data were obtained for various body shapes
at a mach number of 3.12 and reynolds
numbers per foot as high as 15x10 .
  previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shown
agreement with the predictions of stability theory .  for surface roughnesses
ranging from 4 to 1250 microinches the location of transition was
unaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effect
was observed for each of the parameters investigated .  in general, the
transition reynolds number decreased with
decreasing surface temperature .
in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient
obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a
transition reynolds number lower than
that observed on a cone is obtained .
further, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transition
reynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling .

effect of distributed three-dimensional roughness and
surface cooling on boundary layer transition and lateral
spread of turbulence at supersonic speeds .
  an investigation was made in the langley 4 by 4-foot supersonic
pressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) the
effect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with the
model surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the
effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both
distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were
used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire
anemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the
three-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as
that previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical
value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,
the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was
found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds
when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including
density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the
roughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds
number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no
disturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface
cooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small
disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the
critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness
particles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the
boundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due
to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and
reynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the
boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar
stability derived from the surface cooling .

  the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are
re-examined to include the effects of compressibility and property
variations .  if viscous dissipation is neglected,
the compressible problem is
correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations
of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certain
inaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and
corrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as a
distortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and as
a multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt

torque required to rotate the disk .

theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type
heat protection shield of varied material properties
at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm .
  the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a
re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and
nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of
some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic
re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor
of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the
vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5 .
the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed
combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a
calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions
for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight
state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .
  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the
conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,
and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature
profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across
the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is
the only material parameter affecting this thickness .
  a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the
surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although,
these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the
overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely
low viscosity level .

discussion of solar proton events and manned space
flights .
  as a result of studies made during the
international geophysical year (igy) and the
international geophysical cooperation (igc),
it is known that a considerable fraction of
large solar flares give rise to almost pure
streams of protons which reach the earth and
continue to arrive for as long as 11 days .
the energies of these particles lie within a
very steep spectrum extending from 20 to
least 500 mev .  because of the frequency
of large flares during times of high solar
activity, and owing to the long duration of each
solar proton emission, these particles were
present in detectable intensity near the top
of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent
of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number
of large flares that accelerated and released
these particles during this three-year period was about 30 .
  the event that began on august 22, 1958
contributed greatly toward the understanding
of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,
and in addition provided the first
identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may
of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that
this phenomenon was recognized as an
additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles
in the high atmosphere and in most parts
of the solar system .  the three very intense
events that occurred in july, 1959 further
supported this conclusion, and the possibility
of predicting such events became an
important consideration .  in addition to its value
in the protection of human beings, effective
forecasting clearly would be of great value in
the detailed scientific study of this
phenomenon .
  this paper presents a preliminary
discussion of some aspects of predicting the
arrival of protons at the earth following the
appearance of solar activity features and,
equally important, of forecasting the periods
when this penetrating radiation is unlikely
to occur .

pressure of approximately 600 psia .  four different gases were
injected over a range of mass flows .  the heat transfer on the

conditions,. for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surface
temperatures were also determined .  the theoretical analysis of the
boundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish the

on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying
through the atmosphere .
  the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic
speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times
required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)
to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas
particle, are important in determining the observable effects of
hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection
of electromagnetic waves from the trail .
  in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is
divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,
which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a
point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to
the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the
expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,
where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the
high-temperature core .
  the influence of the details of the body shape on the
observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for
the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based
on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume
thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the
thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial
distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density
distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the
conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that
viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion
of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight
velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and
altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .

the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a
porous plate with constant suction velocity in the presence of a
transverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta .  in
this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of
free convection, when a body force is acting parallel to the wall .  the
fluid is assumed to be semi-incompressible as usual .  in addition to
the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in
the sense that it provides another exact solution of the

are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .

an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure
field .
  the present article describes an investigation of several types of
separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed
in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two
dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and
subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry,
and the pressure field are described in this paper .
  a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of
the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated
regions .
  it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length
of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression
in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving
mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion .
this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent
transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or
turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and
reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the
conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary
depth is proposed .
  detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a
cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio
of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be
the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches
the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion
of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear
layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction
governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly
constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches
the shear layer bends inward at separation and
curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the
floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure
at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient
with mach number reflects the change from one to the other
mechanism of recompression .
  detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a
blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as
well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented
and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of
the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of
steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate
for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary .
  results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial
boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth)
and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .

the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary layer flow .
  the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated,
and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter
which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness
to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco
integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are
still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse
curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of
mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer
equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form,
making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions
characterized by and less than or of the order of unity .
it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily
concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term
in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them
from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external
favorable pressure gradient .
  except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the
of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in
ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity
but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic
solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature
distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the
body shapes are given by and and (2) the
velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external
velocity of the form past a body given by .  the
zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a
linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found
for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar
profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that .
here, similar is used in the restricted meaning
that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential
equations .
  in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient
where the equations have been numerically integrated for,
the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that
the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer
rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than
or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are
increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream
temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other
conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction
coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater
than that on the cone .
  for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term
behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to
delay both separation and transition when compared with axially
symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is
neglected .

review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from
laminar to turbulent flow .
a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,
especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to
turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the
available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition
reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a
function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the
displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional
relation being a better representation of the data than a constant
critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the
effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial

a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative
flows and nearly isentropic streams .
  by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper
treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the
interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface
of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic
stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane,
steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane
surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be
extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic
flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow
is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface
on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean
temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity
distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a
relation between mean temperature and mean velocity .
mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to
dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process
determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow .
with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is
shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer
shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base
pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic
nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .

the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence .
statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain
quantities .  in the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean
values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of
squares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o.
reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent
stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the
different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the
establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the
turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity
fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean
velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of
the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the
hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the
experimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his
analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and
was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of
turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory
raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important
problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared
directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by
fage, townend and simmons in england .
the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with
uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a
parallel stream .  first, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is
developed .  this general theory includes taylor's consideration as a
special case .  however, it

vibration isolation of aircraft power plants .
vibration in aircraft structure can almost
always be traced to vibratory forces originating
from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power
plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has
always caused the preponderance of disturbance .
vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life
of the entire aircraft structure .  more important,
however, are the psychological and physiological
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise
on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so
intimately associated with flying .  the importance
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can
hardly be questioned .
  this paper is limited to a consideration of the
directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the
power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means
to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body
of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case
of engines and engine supporting structures having
axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods
employed could easily be extended to other cases .

.W
laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight
speeds .
this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over
blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation
temperatures..  (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical
reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion
across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the
volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/
compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density
near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density
just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation
enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the
more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in
case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is
represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient
value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained
directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to
illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases
of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a
spherical segment .
in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the
diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the
low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced
by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are
also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate
is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat
transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of
thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)
when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value
of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .
additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly
required before these simple results are accepted .

the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel .
  a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working
section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with
varying spacing .
  the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the
flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear
variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream
without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near
the grid .  a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the
rods is described .  although this method is strictly applicable
only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid
designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in
close agreement with the theory .  there was no evidence from
the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying
the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the
resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the
shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .

dynamics of a dissociating gas .
  this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation
in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow
past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec .
thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near
equilibrium for transport properties and of large
departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .
  following a survey of the equilibrium statistical
thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a
new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation .
physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational
modes always just half excited (so that at low
temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather
then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations
deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along
streamlines between shocks .
  various of these results are applied to the problem
typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the
limit for large values of both mach number and density
ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero
surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock
wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the
subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another
approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation
streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a
spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body .
the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that
predicted by freeman's second approximation based on
the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),

the velocity profile, induced currents and
field are derived and solved exactly in the case

surrounded by boundary layers on each wall .
the layers on the walls parallel to the imposed

response of plates to a decaying and convecting randon

  following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the
vibratory response of a plate to a random pressure
field is given .  the pressure correlation of the random
field is assumed to have a scale small compared to
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect
with constant speed over the plate .  two cases are
considered, one in which the convection speed is much
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,
the other in which the convection speed is the same
order as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square plate
displacement is shown to be relatively independent
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in
the order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown that
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means
of vibration reduction .  in the case of convection
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement
response is shown to be limited by the decay of the
assumed random pressure field .

the paper concerns the hydrodynamic turbulent

from the reynolds equations and introducing
the approximations currently used in
lubrication problems, owing to the lubricant film
thickness, the general motion equations for

  using the prandtl mixing length hypothesis,
exact and approximate solutions are
obtained for the velocity distribution into the
lubricant layer .  the results are discussed by
pointing out the pressure gradient and the
reynolds number influence on the velocity
distributions, as well as the differences with
respect to the laminar flow .
  in order to obtain simple formulae, the
exact dependence of the rate of flow on the
pressure gradient into a dimensionless form
is replaced by a linear relation, the slope of
which depends on the reynolds number .
this approximation allows the obtainment of
the pressure differential equation under a
simple form .  the pressure equation is integrated
in case of journal bearings, by assuming a

  the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbolic

as an infinite series of mathieu functions .  it is found that
the stagnation streamline of the flow is displaced towards
a region of higher velocity, this displacement increasing
the main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressively
non-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length when
the major axis length remains invariant .  in each case the
displacement reaches a limiting value as the cylinder moves away
from the axis of symmetry of the stream .  these limiting
values are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry,
which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform,
but these distances are approximately independent of incidence .

coefficients associated with the cylinder have also been obtained,

namely, the flow approaching the trailing edge, the
expansion around the trailing edge, the mixing within the

a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure
around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic
flow .
exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones at
zero angle of attack .  for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle of
attack, only approximate methods exist .  these methods are generally
quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain
mach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simple
approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at
zero incidence as well as at angle of attack .
such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented
here in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/
theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical body
utilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the
same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as
the local element of the body considered .  this method works relatively
well at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lower
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from
circular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory
results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface
element on the body independent of the other body elements in the
newtonian-theory manner .

the downstream influence of mass transfer at the nose
of a slender cone .
  the influence of localized mass transfer at the nose of a slender
cone under hypersonic flow conditions has been studied by
experimental and theoretical means .  two gaseous coolants, nitrogen
and helium, are injected through a porous plug subtending a
half angle of 30 .  the effect of the mass transfer on the shock
shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are
investigated .  the experimental work involved tests in the
mach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal .  the theoretical analysis involved
a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off
distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the
experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution
to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other
coolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of this
parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure
distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which
boundary-layer-type similarity applies .
  significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with
injection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the
peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be
an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation
point without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition is
found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased
over those prevailing at the same reynolds number without
injection .

a summary of the supersonic pressure drag of bodies
of revolution .
  a number of approximate theories for supersonic and
hypersonic flow over bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack are
appraised by a critical comparison with characteristics and
second-order results, with the use of hypersonic similarity as a
basis for the comparison .  most of the approximate theories
are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio
and mach number .  the combination of second-order
supersonic theory and second-order shock-expansion theory provides
consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range .
  on the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions and
a limited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region,
summary design curves are developed that give the pressure
drag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattails
over the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic
mach numbers .  other shapes can be analyzed in the same
manner, provided that an equivalent amount of data is available .
  the analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow,
so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock
boundary-layer interaction, and flow separation are not included .  the
present correlations provide a sound basis of inviscid-flow results
from which these additional viscous effects can be evaluated .

measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulent
boundary layer on a cone with foreign gas injection .
  measurements of average skin friction of the turbulent
boundary layer have been made on a 15 total included angle cone with
foreign gas injection .  measurements of total skin-friction drag
were obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, and
x 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12
through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skin
friction are realized with gas injection within the range of mach
numbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction is
in accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are most
effective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a marked
effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.
this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited
transition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer
does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point
approaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  the
variation of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rates
with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds
number and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates the
skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent
boundary-layer results .

an investigation of the noise produced by a subsonic air jet .
to investigate the theoretical predictions of lighthill on aerodynamic
sound, measurements have been made of the sound field of a 1 in. air jet
issuing from a long pipe .  the measurements have been made over a wide
frequency band (30 to 10,000 cycles/sec.) and in one-third octave bands
in this frequency range .   the mean mach number at the pipe orifice was
varied from 0.3 to 1.0 .
the dependence of the apparent position of the noise sources on
frequency and jet speed was investigated .  at a given frequency a source is
situated farther from the jet orifice the higher the jet speed .  lower
frequency sources appear farther downstream than ones of higher
frequency, consistent with their association with larger eddies .  the
directional characteristics of the sound field at different frequencies
and jet speeds are illustrated by means of scale diagrams showing lines
of constant sound intensity .  these sound fields are analyzed in terms
of the moving quadrupole sources of lighthill's theory and good
agreement obtained .  it is shown that the apparent spread of the sources at
low frequencies is due to the doppler effect .  at low frequency
relative to the frequency of maximum power output) the radiation is
predominantly that of three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoles
which, except for the effect of convection upon it, has a sound field
like a monopole source .  at higher frequencies the sound fields of

two-dimensional jet mixing of a compressible fluid .
  the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into
a supersonic stream are investigated theoretically .
  in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar .
when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer
assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be
reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction,
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions .  it
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two
dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small
perturbations .
  velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a
jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full
expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been
calculated .  the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of
momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of
temperature--i.e., the change of density .  compressibility has a
considerable effect on the properties of the jet .
  in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated .
by means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent
shearing stress may be expressed as
  it has been shown in this paper that
where is a constant that can be determined experimentally .
the value of n lies between 0 and 1 .  the exact value of n
depends on the condition of mixing .
  when the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above
is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion,
by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that
the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical
to that of the laminar case .  hence, the solution of the first part
of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that
the characteristic constants and n have been properly chosen .

viscosity effects in sound waves of finite amplitude:
in survey in mechanics .
  this article has as its subject /the conflicting influence on
sound propagation of convection on the one hand, and of diffusion
and relaxation on the other/, whose importance in the
determination of the structure of shock waves was first appreciated clearly
by sir geoffrey taylor .  as an essential introduction to the main
topics, author gives an exceptionally clear and valuable account
of the physical mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and
other diffusion effects, including relaxation .  the classical theory
of shock-wave formation is then discussed, and some extensions
are made .
  the remainder of the article is based on the demonstration that
the nonlinear equation for plane progressive sound waves, in which
convection and diffusion are taken into account to a first
approximation, can be transformed into burgers's equation, the general
solution of which was given by hopf and cole .  this approach, in
which all flows are continuous (they become discontinuous at
shock waves in the limit as viscosity, etc., tend to zero), allows
the author to re-derive and extend whitham's theory of the
formation and decay of weak plane shock waves, and to derive many
new results, such as the velocity distributions during the union
of two shock waves and during the formation of a shock wave .
the application of the same idea to non-plane shock waves is
also discussed, but more briefly,. in these cases, burgers's
equation is not quite such a good approximation as before .
  the article concludes with sections on sound waves whose
reynolds numbers based on the length scale of the flow and the
velocity amplitude are comparable with unity, and on the effects
of relaxation on the properties of shock waves .  the whole is
much more than a survey, and represents a very substantial
advance in the theory of sound waves .  it is the finest possible
tribute to sir geoffrey taylor that he should be able to inspire
articles such as this and the others in this volume .

some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary
layer flow .
  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a
two-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in
which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is
cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of
motion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are
solved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure
gradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the
surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are
modified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved
surface .
  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the
stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while
the stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the
most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases
considered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile
near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement
that a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the
potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to
have a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface
curvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .

note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid
flow .
according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies
at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as
composed of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow and a thin
boundary-layer region adjacent to the body .  this point of view leads to the
approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer
is negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flow
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge
of the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two
regimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based on
the boundary-layer displacement thickness .
recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this
classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the
two flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient has
been considered .  it is the purpose of the present note to point out
another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of
fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the
hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in
that theory .

the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements
in compressible flows .
it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar
or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined
from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrument
used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated,
heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of the
instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer
generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar
sublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an
instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate .
with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument
as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar
and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate
vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region
of the heated element .  this assumption then permits the use of the
laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this
analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .

wakes in axial compressors .
the tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common
assumption by most of the people working in this field .
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an
assumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when given
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the
distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this
fashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,
this distribution will not normally occur when the
compressor is present and we may normally expect much more
nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the
attendant curved flow to support the static pressure
gradients .

.W
the determination of turbulent skin friction by means
of pitot tubes .
  a simple method of determining
local turbulent skin friction on a smooth
surface has been developed which utilises a
round pitot tube resting on the surface .
assuming the existence of a region near the
surface in which conditions are functions
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical
constants of the fluid and a suitable length,
a universal non-dimensional relation is
obtained for the difference between the total
pressure recorded by the tube and the static
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin
friction .  this relation, on this assumption,
is independent of the pressure gradient .
the truth and form of the relation were first
established, to a considerable degree of
accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter
being taken as representative length .  these four
pitot tubes were then used to determine
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations
on a wind tunnel wall, under varying
conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station,
within the limits of experimental
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was
found to be the same for each pitot
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and
leaving little doubt as to the correctness
of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses
were then made in the pipe and in the
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results
were plotted in two non-dimensional
forms on the basis already suggested and they
fell close together in a region whose
outer limit represented the breakdown of the
basic assumption, but close to the wall
the results spread out, due to the unknown
displacement of the effective centre of a
pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides
further evidence of the existence of a
region of local dynamical similarity and of the
correctness of the skin friction deduced
from measurements with round pitot tubes on
the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the
region in which the local dynamical similarity
may be expected to hold appears to vary
from about to of the boundary-layer
thickness for conditions remote from,
and close to, separation respectively .

analytic expressions in the form of fourier sums are obtained
for the temperature distribution in a composite wall
consisting of an inner (refractory) medium and an outer
metallic) medium under newtonian heat transfer into the

representative model for relatively thin cylindrical walls, with
thickness-to-radius ratio not exceeding 0.2 .  the general
results for the composite slab are simplified for the limiting
cases of a thin refractory shield with a thick shielded

skin friction in the laminar boundary layer in compressible
flow .
  from an analysis of the work of
crocco and others, semi-empirical formulae
are derived for the skin friction on a
flat plate at zero incidence with a laminar
boundary layer .  these formulae are
for the general case of heat transfer, and
when there is no heat transfer .
  the problem of heat transfer and
the effect of radiation are discussed in the
light of these formulae .  the second
formula is then utilised in the development of
an approximate method for solving the
momentum equation of the boundary layer
on a cylinder without heat transfer .
the method indicates that with increase of

supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous
profile slope .
  ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first
approximations to the external forces on slender
bodies of general cross section
with discontinuous profile slope .  two
classes of body are considered ..
bodies whose profile (typified by the local
radius) is continuous between the
nose and base, and certain bodies whose
profile is discontinuous, such as
bodies with annular or side air intakes and
wing-bodies on which the wing
has an unswept leading edge .  (where air
intakes are concerned, it is
assumed that they are sharp-edged and that
there is no /spillage/ of the
internal flow) .
  the following conclusions apply to
the former class of bodies .  the
variation of drag with mach number is
found to depend only on the
discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change
of the cross-sectional area, and is
thus independent of cross-sectional shape .
the drag itself is unchanged if
the direction of the flow is reversed .  the
expressions for lift and moment
assume the same forms as for smooth pointed
bodies, the lift depending only
on conditions at the base of the body .
  the general theory is applied to
winged bodies of revolution with an
unswept wing leading edge ..  the results
bear a marked resemblance to those
obtained by ward .  the results for wings
alone are seen to be applicable,
with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .

  some recent theoretical work on slender pointed wings at zero lift is

considered may have any pointed plan

edge is straight and unswept .  the root
section profile and cross-section shapes

for instance), though not necessarily
geometrically similar .  the chief aim of
the work is to find wings with simple
geometry, low wave drag and pressure
distributions which are unlikely to be
seriously affected by viscous effects .
wave drag and pressure distributions
are calculated by slender-wing theory .
general formulae, which are both simple

drag and the overall pressure distribution,
with particular emphasis on the root

on displacement thickness .
  four alternative theoretical treatments of 'displacement
thickness', and, generally, of the influence of boundary layers
and wakes on the flow outside them, are set out, first for
two-dimensional, and then for three-dimensional, laminar or turbulent,
incompressible flow .  they may be called the methods of 'flow
reduction', 'equivalent sources', 'velocity comparison' and
  the principal expression obtained for the displacement
thickness in three-dimensional flow may be written
if, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on the
surface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the external
flow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flow
streamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) and
z is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y components
of velocity, and u takes the value u just outside the boundary layer .

expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past
a sphere and a circular cylinder .
  this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher
approximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder
than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes
and oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the
consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular
one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for
taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution
for small reynolds numbers .
  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid
the regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are
presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions
are, respectively, of the forms
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds
number, and and vanish with r .  substitution
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a
set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that
unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from
the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which
yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each
expansion .
  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely
related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed
results for some further terms are obtained .

the generation of noise by isotropic turbulence .
a finite region, with fixed boundaries, of an
infinite expanse of compressible fluid is in
turbulent motion .  this motion generates noise
and radiates it into the surrounding fluid .
the acoustic properties of the system are studied
in the special case in which the turbulent
region consists of decaying isotropic turbulence .
it is assumed that the reynolds number
of the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is small .
  the noise appears to be generated mainly
by those eddies of the turbulence whose
contribution to the rate of dissipation of kinetic
energy by viscosity is negligible .
  it is shown that the intensity of sound at large
distances from the turbulence is the same
as that due to a volume distribution of simple acoustic
sources occupying the turbulent region .
in this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regarded
as a stationary and uniform acoustic
medium .  the local value of the acoustic power output
p per mass of turbulent fluid is given
approximately by the formula
where a is a numerical constant, u is the
mean-square velocity fluctuation, is the time, and
c is the velocity of sound in the fluid .  the
constant a is expressed in terms of the well-known
velocity correlation function f(r) by
assuming the joint probability distribution of the
turbulent velocities and their first two
time-derivatives at two points in space to be
gaussian .  the numerical value is
then obtained by substituting the form of f(r)
corresponding to heisenberg's theoretical
spectrum of isotropic turbulence .
  it is found that the effects of decay make
only a small contribution to the value of a, and
that the order of magnitude of a is not changed
when widely differing forms of the function
f(r) are used .

on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle .
it is well known that according to classical hydrodynamics a steady
stream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultant
force upon an obstacle, such as a rigid sphere, immersed in it .  the
development of a /resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, or
when there is a sharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompany
it (helmholtz) .  in either case it would seem that resistance involves
something of the nature of a wake, extending behind the obstacle to an
infinite distance .  when the system of disturbed velocities, although
it may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached to
the obstacle, there can be no resistance .
the absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., but
it can hardly be supposed that a small degree of compressibility, as in
water, would affect the conclusion .  on the other hand, high relative
velocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alter
the conditions .  it seems worth while to examine this question more
closely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenable
to mathematical treatment .

.W
the effect of shallow water on wave resistance .
  the general character of experimental
results dealing with the effect of
shallow water on ship resistance may be
stated briefly as follows ..--at low
velocities the resistance in shallow
water is greater than in deep water, the
speed at which the excess is first
appreciable varying with the type of vessel .
as the speed increases, the excess
resistance increases up to a maximum at a
certain critical velocity, and then
diminishes .  with still further increase of
speed, the resistance in shallow
water ultimately becomes, and remains, less
than that in deep water at the same speed .
the maximum effect is the more
pronounced the shallower the water .
for further details and references one
may refer to standard treatises, but one
quotation may be made in regard to
the critical velocity ..  /this maximum
appears to be at about a speed such
that a trochoidal wave travelling at this
speed in water of the same depth is
about times as long as the vessel .
it was at one time supposed
that the speed for maximum increase
in resistance was that of the wave of
translation .  this, however, holds only
for water whose depth is less than
for greater depths the speed of the
wave of translation rapidly becomes
greater than the speed of maximum
increase of resistance ./  in a recent
analysis of the data, h. m. weitbrecht
expresses a similar conclusion by stating
that for each depth of water there is
a critical velocity, but that the critical
velocity does not vary as the square
root of the corresponding depth .

approximate analytical solutions for hypersonic flow
past slender power-law bodies .
approximate analytical solutions are presented
for two-dimensional and axisymmetric
hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies whose
shapes follow a power law variation .  in particular,
the body shape is given by where is the
transverse body ordinate, is the streamwise distance
from the nose, and m is a constant in the range .
both zero-order
solutions and first-order (small but nonvanishing values
of solutions are presented, where m is the
free-stream mach number and is a characteristic
body or streamline slope .  the zero-order shock shape
is similar to the body shape for these flows .  the
solutions are found within the framework of
hypersonic-slender-body theory .
  the limiting case m=1 corresponds to a wedge
or cone flow .  the limiting case
corresponds to a constant-energy flow .
the latter cases are included
so that the present study may be applied to all flows
wherein the zero-order shock shape is given by
with m in the range .  flow
fields associated with shock shapes having values of m
outside this range are also discussed .  for all values
of, except m=1, certain portions of the flow field
riolate the hypersonic-slender-body approximations,
while other portions are consistent with these
approximations .  for m=1, all portions of the flow field
are consistent with the approximations .
  the approximate solutions are found as follows .
the asymptotic form of the flow in the vicinity of the
body surface is used as a guide to write approximate
expressions for the dependent variables .  these
expressions exactly satisfy the continuity and
energy equations and contain arbitrary constants
which are evaluated so as to satisfy boundary
conditions at the shock .  the approximate solutions do
not satisfy the lateral momentum equation except at
the shock and (for the first-order problem) at the body
surface .
  the results of the approximate solutions are
compared with numerical integrations of the
equations of motion for various values of m and (ratio
of specific heats) .  good agreement is noted,
particularly when m and are both near one .  the
shock is relatively close to the body for the latter
cases .  sufficient results are presented to evaluate
the accuracy of the approximate method for various

nearly circular transfer trajectories for descending
satellites .
  simplified expressions describing the transfer
from a satellite orbit to the point of atmospheric
entry are derived .  the expressions are limited to
altitude changes that are small compared with the
earth's radius, and velocity changes small compared
with satellite velocity .  they are further restricted
to motion about a spherical, nonrotating earth .
  the transfer orbit resulting from the application
of thrust in any direction at any point in an elliptic
orbit is considered .  expressions for the errors in
distance (miss distance) and entry angle due to an
initial misalinement and magnitude error of the
deflecting thrust are presented .
  the largest potential contributing factor towards
a miss distance stems from the misalinement of the
retrovelocity increment .  if this velocity increment is
pointed in direct opposition to the flight path, a 1
misalinement leads to a miss distance of 34.5 miles .
however, it is shown that this error can be avoided
by applying the velocity increment at an angle
between 120 and 150 below the flight-path direction .
  the guidance and accuracy requirements to
establish a circular orbit, in addition to the corrections
applied to transform elliptic orbits into circular
ones, are also discussed .

an analysis of the corridor and guidance requirements
for supercircular entry planetary atmospheres .
  an analysis is presented of supercircular entry
into a planet's atmosphere giving particular attention
to the corridor through which spacecraft must be
guided in order to accomplish various maneuvers .
a dimensionless parameter based on conditions at
the conic perigee altitude is introduced for
characterizing supercircular entries and conveniently
prescribing corridor widths associated with elliptic,
parabolic, or hyperbolic approach trajectories .  the
analysis applies to vehicles of arbitrary weight, shape,
and size .  illustrative calculations are made for
venus, earth, mars, jupiter, and titan .
  for nonlifting vehicles having fixed aerodynamic
coefficients, curves are presented of dimensionless
parameters from which can be calculated the maximum
deceleration, maximum rate of laminar convective
heating, and total laminar heat absorbed during
single-pass entry at velocities up to twice circular
velocity .  for lifting vehicles, curves are presented of
the maximum deceleration and overshoot boundary
of an entry corridor,. equations are presented for
estimating laminar aerodynamic heating from the
maximum deceleration .  it is shown that the corridor
width is independent of vehicle weight, dimensions,
and drag coefficient, provided these are the same at
the overshoot boundary as at undershoot .  the
corridors of certain planets can be broadened
markedly by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for
example, the 10-earth-g corridor width for
single-pass, nonlifting, parabolic entry is increased from
to 52, 51, and 52 miles, respectively, by employing a
lift-drag ratio of 1 .  the use of aerodynamic lift
does not increase appreciably the corridors of mars
and titan .  all corridor widths decrease rapidly
as the entry velocity is increased .
  terminal guidance requirements on accuracy of
velocity and flight path angle for successfully entering
various corridors are compared with analogous
requirements for putting a satellite into orbit, for
hitting the moon from the earth, and for achieving
icbm accuracy .  consideration is given to the
terminal guidance problem involved in using a
planet's atmosphere--rather than rocket fuel--to
effect orbital transfers from heliocentric to
planeto-centric motion, thereby converting a hyperbolic
approach trajectory to an elliptic orbit about the
target planet .  this fuel saving maneuver appears
technologically feasible for certain planetary voyages,
and implies the possibility of achieving a large
reduction in required earth lift-off weight of chemical
propulsion systems .

an approximate analytical method for studying entry

.W
an approximate analytical method for studying entry
into planetary atmospheres .
  the pair of motion equations for entry into a
planetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary,
nonlinear differential equation of second order by
disregarding two relatively small terms and by
introduring a certain mathematical transformation .  the
reduced equation includes various terms, certain of
which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal
acceleration, and the lift force .  if these particular
terms are disregarded, the differential equation is
linear and yields precisely the solution of allen and
eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep
angles of descent .  if all the other terms in the basic
equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible
vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component
of drag force), the resulting truncated differential
equation yields the solution of sanger for equilibrium
flight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-drag
ratios .
  a number of solutions for lifting and nonlifting
vehicles entering at various initial angles also have
been obtained from the complete nonlinear equation .
these solutions are universal in the sense that a
single solution determines the motion and heating
of a vehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, and
shape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphere .
one solution is required for each lift-drag ratio .
these solutions are used to study the deceleration,
heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry into
venus, earth, mars, and jupiter .  from the
equations developed for heating rates, and from
available information on human tolerance limits
to acceleration stress, approximate conditions for
minimizing the aerodynamic heating of a trimmed
vehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are established
for several types of manned entry .  a brief study
is included of the process of atmosphere braking for
slowing a vehicle from near escape velocity to near
satellite velocity .

skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow .
experiments have been conducted to measure in
incompressible flow the local surface-shear stress
and the average skin-friction coefficient for a turbulent
boundary-layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient .
the local surface-shear stress was measured by a floating-element
skin-friction balance and also by a calibrated total head
tube located on the surface of the test wall . the
average skin-friction coefficient was obtained from
boundary-layer velocity profiles . the
boundary-layer profiles were also used to determine the location
of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer .
data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbers
from 1 million to about 45 million with an attendant
change in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32 .
   the measured local skin-friction coefficients
obtained with the floating-element balance agree
well with those of schultz-grunow and kempf
for reynolds numbers up to 45 million . the
measured average skin-friction coefficients agree
with those given by the schoenherr curve in the
ranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 million
and 30 to 45 million . in the range of reynolds
numbers from 3 to 30 million the measured values
are less than those predicted by the schoenherr        curve .
the results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/
proposed by coles appraoch asymptotically
a constant value at reynolds numbers exceeding
mentioned constants and the limited reynolds
number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt
as to the validity of any turbulent
skin-friction law written on the basis of the present
results . hence, no new friction law is proposed .
   the frictional resistance of a flat plate was
calculated by means of the momentum method and
also the integrated measured local surface shear .
for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million
both methods give about the same result,. whereas
at lower values of reynolds number the momentum
method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for
the effects of turbulence results in a frictional
resistance as much as 4 percent higher than that
of the integrated shear .
the measurement of local surface shear by a

flow of chemically reacting gas mixtures .
  suitable forms of the equations
for the flow of an inviscid,
non-heat-conducting gas in which chemical
reactions are occurring are derived .
the effects of mass diffusion and
non-equilibrium amongst the internal
modes of the molecules are neglected .
  special attention is given to
the speeds of sound in such a gas
mixture and a general expression for
the ratio of frozen to equilibrium
sound speeds is deduced .  an example
is given for the ideal dissociating
gas .  the significance of the velocity
defined by the ratio of the convective
derivatives of pressure and density is
explained .  it is the velocity
which exists at the throat of a
convergent-divergent duct under maximum
mass flow conditions, and it is shown that
this velocity depends on the
nozzle geometry as well as on the 'reservoir' conditions .
  as an illustration the phenomena of
sound absorption and dispersion are
discussed for the ideal dissociating gas .
the results can be concisely
expressed in terms of the frozen and
equilibrium sound speeds, the
frequency of the (harmonic) sound
vibration and a characteristic time for
the rate of progress of the reaction .

heat conduction through a gas with one inert internal

  the rate of energy transfer between
parallel flat plates is evaluated
when the (stagnant) gas between them is
polyatomic with one inert internal
mode .  deviations of the thermal
conductivity from the complete equilibrium
of the inert mode relaxation time
and the effectiveness of the walls in
exciting or de-exciting this mode .
the results are obtained via a linear
theory consistent with small
temperature differences between the plates .
  it is found that the eucken-value
of conductivity could be exceeded
if the relaxation times are non-zero and
the plates very effective in
exciting the inert mode .  when relaxation
times are very short the effect
of the walls on the energy transfer rate
is small, but the walls make
their presence felt by distorting the
temperature profiles in /boundary
layers/ adjacent to the walls which are
of order in thickness
time) .  this result is
analogous to hirschfelder's (1956) for the
case of chemical reactions .
  for experimental measurement of
conductivity in a hot wire cell type
of apparatus it is shown that extrapolation
of measured reciprocal
conductivities to zero reciprocal pressure
should load to the full eucken
value .  it is also shown that the slope of
reciprocal apparent (measured)
conductivity versus reciprocal pressure
curves is a function of relaxation
time as well as of the accommodation
coefficients .  it is quite possible
that the relaxation effect here is
comparable with the temperature jump
effects, even for rotation in diatomic molecules .

on the sudden contact between a hot gas and a cold solid .
the flow induced by the sudden contact between a semi-infinite expanse
of gas and a solid, initially at different temperatures, is examined on
the basis of a linear continuum theory .  for times large compared with
the mean time between molecular collisions in the gas, the velocity
and pressure disturbances are found to be concentrated around a wave
front propagating out from the interface at the ambient isentropic sound
speed, whilst, near to the interface, these disturbances are small and
the gas temperatures are nearly equal to those predicted by the
classical constant pressure heat conduction theory .
the possible significance of these results in connection with
reflected shock wave techniques to measure high temperature gas properties is
commented upon .

the interaction of a reflected shock wave with the

  ideally, the reflection of a shock
from the closed end of a shock
tube provides, for laboratory study,
a quantity of stationary gas at
extremely high temperature .  because
of the action of viscosity, however,
the flow in the real case is not
one-dimensional, and a boundary layer
grows in the fluid following the initial shock wave .
  in this paper simplifying assumptions
are made to allow an analysis
of the interaction of the shock reflected
from the closed end with the
boundary layer of the initial shock
afterflow .  the analysis predicts
that interactions of several different
types will exist in different
ranges of initial shock mach number .
it is shown that the cooling
effect of the wall on the afterflow
boundary layer accounts for the change
in interaction type .
  an experiment is carried out which
verifies the existence of the
several interaction regions and shows
that they are satisfactorily
predicted by the theory .  along with these
results, sufficient information
is obtained from the experiments to make
possible a model for the
interaction in the most complicated case .
this model is further verified
by measurements made during the experiment .
  the case of interaction with a
turbulent boundary layer is also
considered .  identifying the type of
interaction with the state of
turbulence of the interacting boundary
layer allows for an estimate of the
state of turbulence of the boundary
layer based on an experimental
investigation of the type of interaction .

some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody
combination .
  the aerodynamic problems associated with
propulsion-system installations have assumed a role
of vital importance in the development of supersonic
aircraft .  although air-induction systems have received
moderate attention in the literature, considerably less
information can be found on the design and installation
of turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be
interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit
design .
  as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes
increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations
which are efficient over the entire speed range .  the
difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of
high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always
compatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it
is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle
and afterbody performance .  rather they must be
treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet
interaction with the external stream must be taken into
account .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame
designers must closely coordinate their efforts .
  some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle
afterbody combinations are outlined in this report .
particular attention is devoted to the influence of the
jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and
after-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock-
boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach,
although not precise, correctly predicts many trends
and is generally enlightening .

the effect of a central jet on the base pressure of
a cylindrical afterbody in a supersonic stream .
  this report describes an experimental investigation
of the factors affecting the base flow and
jet structure behind a cylindrical after-body with a central nozzle .
seven interchangeable nozzles were tested .
six of these were convergent-divergent, with a design mach
number of 2.0, jet base diameter ratios ranging
from 0.2 to 0.8 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from
convergent with a jet base diameter ratio of 0.6 .
  in the main experimental programme the free-stream
mach number was 2.0 and the boundary layer was
turbulent both on the after-body and in the nozzle .
measurements were made of the base pressure, the surface
pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust
and the nozzle mass flow, over a range of jet pressures .
this programme was supplemented by comparative
tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests) .
readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures
and the jet thrust at different jet pressures .  schlieren
photography was used extensively throughout .
  the results of the tests with external flow are
presented in the form of curves showing the separate effects
of jet pressure ratio, jet base diameter ratio, nozzle
design mach number and nozzle divergence angle on the
base pressure and overall thrust .  the special case
of base bleed is discussed separately .  similar curves are
included for the static tests .  these show the effect
of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrust .
  a general method of correlating data on annular
base pressures is proposed and discussed .  essentially, this
method compares the pressure on an annular
base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding
two-dimensional base .  it correlates the present
results reasonably well, but is less successful when applied
to more extensive data .

investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of

  an investigation has been conducted
in the langley 9-inch supersonic
tunnel to determine the jet effects for
varying jet mach number and
nozzle divergence angle upon the pressure
on the base annulus of a model with
a cylindrical afterbody .  the tests
were conducted over a wide range of
jet static pressure ratios and at a
reynolds number of approximately
free-stream mach numbers of 1.62, 1.94,
and 2.41 .  all testing was conducted
with an artificially induced
turbulent boundary layer along the model .
  in the lower range of jet static
pressure ratios, jet flow from a
sonic or supersonic nozzle affected
the pressure acting on the base
annulus in essentially the same manner
as shown in naca rm e53h25 which covers
jet static pressure ratios up to about
present results showed that the base
pressure tends to level off with
increasing jet static pressure ratio,
and at the extreme static pressure
ratios reached in tests with sonic
nozzles the base pressure began to
decrease .  except in the lower range
of jet static pressure ratios,
nozzle divergence angle generally had a
larger effect on the base pressures
than nozzle mach number,. the increase
in base pressure for a change in
divergence angle from 0 to 10 was
small compared to the increase when
the divergence angle was changed from
and other data indicates that the effects
of divergence angle were reduced
when the ratio of jet exit diameter to base
diameter was decreased .  jet
mach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number .

the mixing of free axially-symmetrical jets of mach number 1.40 .
axially-symmetrical, supersonic, fully-expanded jets of diameter
about 0.75 in. and of mach number 1.40 issuing into an atmosphere
at rest were investigated by schlieren and shadow photography and
by pressure traversing .  the development of the jets was found to
depend critically on the strength of the shock waves in the core of the
jet at the nozzle exit .  with strong shock waves present the jet spread
very rapidly and was very unsteady .  the jet did in some cases break up
into large eddies of the same size as the diameter of the jet .  when
no disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreading
was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadiness .
the turbulent mixing region of the first part of the jet with strong
shock waves was investigated in detail by pitot tubes .  the first
inch was found to correspond to a two-dimensional half-jet .  the
velocity profiles were similar and well represented by the error
integral .  the rate of spreading was only half the value for
low-speed flow .  by integrations across the mixing region the
entrainment and the loss of kinetic energy were determined .
these quantities were found to agree well with the values estimated by
assuming an error-integral velocity profile .

  in the first part of the

pressure in an inviscid fluid,
both for two-dimensional and
axially-symmetric flow .  it is shown that
for two-dimensional flow, and also for
the flow over a body of revolution
with a cylindrical sting attached to
the base, there are an infinite
number of possible solutions satisfying
all necessary boundary conditions
at any given free-stream mach number .
for the particular case of a body
having no sting attached only one
solution is possible in an inviscid
flow, but it corresponds to zero
base drag .  accordingly, it is concluded
that a strictly inviscid-fluid
theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applications .
  since the exact inviscid-fluid
theory does not adequately describe
the conditions of a real fluid flow,
an approximate semi-empirical theory
for base pressure in a viscous fluid
is developed in a second part of the
investigation .  the semi-empirical
theory is based partly on
inviscid-flow calculations, and is restricted
to airfoils and bodies without
boat-tailing .  in this theory an attempt
is made to allow for the effects of
mach number, reynolds number, profile
shape, and type of boundary-layer
flow .  the results of some recent
experimental measurements of base
pressure in two-dimensional and
axially-symmetric flow are presented for
purposes of comparison .  some
experimental results also are presented

only when aircraft and model are identical

  by limiting consideration to
conduction effects, by assuming the major
load carrying parts of the structure
are in regions where the flow is either
entirely laminar, or entirely turbulent,
and by assuming a specific
relationship between reynolds number and nusselt
number, an approach to similarity can
be achieved for small scale models .

required to check on the validity of these assumptions .

some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in
aerodynamic research .
a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in
compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .
most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,
chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of
specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based
on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a
suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas
mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is
nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and
comprised of commercially available components .
calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs
comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of
three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given
mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture
wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be
appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a
corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages
can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .
the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and
proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at
flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the
relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with
temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall
within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer
research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl
number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .

base pressure in supersonic flow .
  the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake
configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an
extremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total
drag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure in
this region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimental
work has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a
satisfactory method for accurate predictions .
  this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally
confirm analytically deduced concepts .  a large amount of
experimental data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and
cone-cylinders has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 .
the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical
deductions .  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is
concluded that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effect
on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for
two-dimensional bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of
the order .
  reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in the
field of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .

investigation of separated flows in supersonic and subsonic
streams with emphasis on the effect of transition .
experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on
flow separation associated with steps, bases, compression corners,
curved surfaces, shock-wave boundary-layer reflections, and
configurations producing leading-edge separation . results were
obtained from pressure-distribution measurements,
shadow-graph observations, high-speed motion pictures, and oil-film
optics . the maximum scope of measurement encompassed
mach numbers between 0.4 and 3.6, and length reynolds
numbers between 4000 and 5000000 .
   the principal variable controlling pressure distribution in
the separated flows was found to be the location of transition
relative to the reattachment and separation positions .
classification is made of each separated flow into one of three regimes ..
and /turbulent/ with transition upstream of separation .
by this means of classificaiton it is possible to state rather
literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence
of reynolds number within each regime .
for certain pure laminar separations a theory for calculating
dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic
and supersonic experiments . this theory involves no empirical
information and provides an explanation of why transition
location relative to reattachment is important . a simple analysis
of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external
flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the
pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress
at the beginning of interaction . various experiments substantiate tnis
variation for most test conditions . an incidental
observation is that the stability of a separated laminar mixing
layer increases markedly with an increase in mach number .
the possible significance of this observation is discussed .

experimental investigation of base pressure on blunt-trailing-edge
wings of supersonic velocities .
  measurements of base pressure are presented for 29
blunt-trailing-edge wings having an aspect ratio of 3.0 and various
airfoil profiles .  the different profiles comprised thickness
ratios between 0.05 and 0.10, boattail angles between --2.9
and 20, and ratios of trailing-edge thickness to airfoil thickness
between 0.2 and 1.0 .  the tests were conducted at mach numbers
of 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.1 .  for each mach number, the reynolds
number and angle of attack were varied .  the lowest reynolds
number investigated was 0.2 x 10 and the highest was 3.5 x 10 .
measurements on each wing were obtained separately with
turbulent flow and laminar flow in the boundary layer .
span-wise surveys of the base pressure were conducted on several
wings .
  the results with turbulent boundary-layer flow showed only
small effects on base pressure of variations in reynolds number,
airfoil profile shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack .  the
principal variable affecting the base pressure for turbulent flow
was the mach number .  at the highest mach number
investigated (3.1), the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to
trailing-edge thickness also affected the base pressure significantly .
  the results obtained with laminar boundary-layer flow to
the trailing edge showed that the effect of reynolds number on
base pressure was large .  in all but a few exceptional cases
the effects on base pressure of variations in angle of attack and
in profile shape upstream of the base were appreciable though
not large .  the principal variable affecting the base pressure
for laminar flow was the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to
trailing-edge thickness .
  for a few exceptional cases involving laminar flow to the
trailing edge, the effects on base pressure of variations in profile
shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack were found to be
unusually large .  in such cases the variation of base pressure
with angle of attack was discontinuous and exhibited a
hysteresis .  stroboscopic schlieren observations at a mach number
of 1.5 indicated that these apparently special phenomena were
associated with a vortex trail of relatively high frequency .

a theory for the core of a leading edge vortex .
  in the flow past a slender delta wing
at incidence can be observed a
roughly axially symmetric core of spiralling
fluid, formed by the rolling up
of the shear layer that separates from a
leading edge .  the aim in this
report is to predict the flow field within
this vortex core, given
appropriate conditions at its outside edge .
  the basic assumptions are
core .
in addition it is assumed that the flow
is axially symmetric and incompressible .
together, these admit outer and inner
solutions for the core from the equations
of motion .
  for the outer solution the sub-core
is ignored, and the flow is taken to
be inviscid (but rotational) and conical .
the resulting solution consists of
simple expressions for the velocity components
and pressure .  for the inner
solution, which applies to the diffusive
sub-core, the flow is taken to be
laminar, and approximations, some based on
the boundary conditions and some
analogous to those of boundary layer theory,
are made .  the solution obtained
in this case is a first approximation, and is
presented in tabular form .
  a sample calculation yields results
which are in good qualitative and

of the body surface at section x is proportional to x, where the radial
coordinate have the comparable order value with the thickness of the
boundary layer .  here, /similar/ is used in the direct meaning that
distributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwise .
calculations are accomplished for the region of strong interaction
between the boundary layer and the shock wave .  from several calculations
it may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, the
thickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity component u is
rapidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of the
boundary layer, only the normal component v is increased .  further if
the thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shock
wave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall are
also increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreased .  the
nose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layer

.W
a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic
speeds .
steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is
investigated analyticially . with the assumption that air behaves
as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion
method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to
extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection
angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock
detachment . this result applies not only to the determination of the
surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the
whole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observation
is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by
extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave
curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure
distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of
attack .
an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin
airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found
to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach
numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . this
slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may
prove useful for some engineering purposes .
effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed
flow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particular
attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific
heats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below
to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially
as accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation is
verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a
generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable
for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine .
the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average
value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field .
this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for
imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows .
an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach
numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may
approach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that the
shock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the
busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach
number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with
reasonable accuracy .

correlation of theoretical and photo-thermoelastic

after a rather complete exploratory program
described in previous papers, the
photo-thermoelastic method was applied to the
experimental evaluation of the thermal-stress
theories .  the new technique was correlated
with several theories which analyzed the
transient thermal stresses in idealized wing
structures of high-speed aircraft .  various
theories were investigated which represented
the same idealized wing models and
differed from each other only in the simplifying
assumptions regarding the temperature
distributions in skin and webs .  the theories
were evaluated by duplicating the boundary
and initial conditions on plastic models and
then by correlating the theories with the
observed fringe orders in nondimensional form .
a significant general conclusion was
reached after correlating the available theories
and experimental results .  owing to
simplifying assumptions concerning the thermal
behavior in the flanges, thermal
stresses predicted by the available theories are all
higher than the experimental
observation .  in some cases the discrepancy is as great as 30 per cent .

pressure distributions . axially symmetric bodies in
oblique flow .
  a simple picture, known from the work of i. lotz, of the flow over
the forward part of a body of revolution in oblique flow is derived
here from entirely elementary considerations .  the pressure at any
point of the (forward part of the) body at any angle of incidence
depends on three parameters whose values vary along the body .  the
variation of these parameters along the body can be determined from a
relatively small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measurements .
the necessary water tunnel measurements have been made for four axially
symmetric head shapes .  additional measurements have been made to
illustrate the theoretical conclusions .  the data for each head shape
are adequate for a determination of the pressure coefficient at any
point on the head shapes at any angle of incidence (up to 6, say) .
in particular they can be used to determine the peak suction at any
angle of incidence and so the conditions for the onset of cavitation
on the head .

pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution
to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and

  this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in
the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying
reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of
revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  the
effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions
and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is
also included .
  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .
the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x
diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .
  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects
were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the
normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow
reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical
approximations .
  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the
incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good
agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the
body .
  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the
pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a
mach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause a
small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .

  an investigation has been conducted in the langley

design data for one family of approximately ellipsoidal spinners .
in the main part of the investigation, 11 of the related spinners
were tested in various combinations with 9 naca open-nose
cowlings, which were also tested without spinners .  the effects
of location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surface
of the cowling lip, and operation of a propeller having
approximately oval shanks were investigated briefly .  in addition, a
study was conducted to determine the correct procedure for
extrapolating design conditions determined from the low-speed
test data to the design conditions at the actual flight mach
number .
  the design conditions for the naca 1-series cowlings and
cowling-spinner combinations are presented in the form of
charts from which, for wide ranges of spinner proportions and
rates of internal flow, cowlings with near-maximum pressure
recovery can be selected for critical mach numbers ranging from
spinners and the effects of the spinners and the propeller on
the cowling design conditions are presented separately to
provide initial quantitative data for use in a general design
procedure through which naca 1-series cowlings can be
selected for use with spinners of other shapes .  by use of this
general design procedure, correlation curves established from
the test data, and derived compressible-flow equations relating
the inlet-velocity ratio to the surface pressures on the cowling

measurement of two dimensional derivatives on a wing-aileron-tab

  measurements have been made of the direct
two-dimensional damping and stiffness derivatives for a

  corrections arising from the apparatus are discussed and
reference is made to an attempt to measure the direct
tab derivatives .
  the effects are shown of frequency parameter, amplitude of
oscillation, reynolds number, aileron angle and position
of transition on the wing .
  variation with frequency parameter is substantially the
same as for vortex-sheet theory and variation of amplitude
produces little change in both derivatives .  at the lowest
reynolds number there is little change in both derivatives
with variation of aileron angle for the condition of natural
transition, but at higher reynolds numbers the stiffness
derivatives increase at .
  a forward movement of transition reduces the stiffness
derivatives at the smaller aileron angles, but at,
at the lowest reynolds number, an increase results .
  similar trends are observed for the damping derivatives above .
  comparison with vortex-sheet theory shows that the
measured values of the stiffness and damping
derivatives are approximately 0.6 of the theoretical values .
  measurements have been made of the direct
tab derivatives and cross aileron-tab derivatives for a
per cent aileron and 4 per cent (approx.) tab .  in addition
some measurements of the direct aileron derivatives have been
made for comparison with earlier results together with a
number of static derivatives for the wing and controls .
  the influence is shown of frequency parameter, reynolds
number, position of transition, mean tab angle and sealing
of the control hinge gaps .  some tests have been made with
the ailcron set at minus 8 deg and the tab at plus 12 deg
for which condition the hinge moment on the aileron was zero .
  reasonable agreement with the values given by the /equivalent
profile/ theory is shown for both direct damping
derivatives and for the direct tab stiffness derivative .  the direct
aileron stiffness derivative shows some departure from

supersonic flow past oscillating airfoils including
nonlinear thickness effects .
  a solution to second order in thickness is derived for
harmonically oscillating two-dimensional airfoils in supersonic
flow .  for slow oscillations of an arbitrary profile, the result is
found as a series including the third power of frequency .  for
arbitrary frequencies, the method of solution for any specific
profile is indicated, and the explicit solution derived for a single
wedge .
  nonlinear thickness effects are found generally to reduce the
torsional damping, and so to enlarge the range of mach numbers
within which torsional instability is possible .  this
destabilizing effect varies only slightly with frequency in the range
involved in dynamic stability analysis, but may reverse to a
stabilizing effect at high flutter frequencies .  comparison with
a previous solution exact in thickness suggests that nonlinear
effects of higher than second order are practically negligible .
  the analysis utilizes a smoothing technique that replaces
the actural problem by one involving no kinked streamlines .
this stratagem eliminates all consideration of shock waves
from the analysis, yet yields the correct solution for problems
that actually contain shock waves .

  the term flutter is used here to denote maintained or
violent oscillations of a structure due to aerodynamic forces
acting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forces .
attention is restricted to this particular branch of the more
general field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting,
divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrew
flutter is not specifically considered .  the monograph is
divided into three main parts, each of which has been made
self-contained for the convenience of readers .
  in the first part, general methods for the investigation
of aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experiments
on flutter models, are set out and discussed .  a detailed
account of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniform
motion is not included, since this has already been provided
elsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamic
forces required in a theoretical flutter analysis are logically
developed, and a bibliography of researches on the
aerodynamic theory is given in the appendix .  investigations
on specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter,
control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in part
these various types of flutter are considered, but the practical
details of flutter-prevention devices are omitted .  finally,
in part 3, methods for the experimental determination of
airloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, and
available airload measurements are analysed and compared
with theoretical results .
  an attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevant
british work reported by the early part of 1947 .  foreign
work has been mentioned in parts 1 and 2 only where necessary
for the sake of completeness, but in part 3 and the
appendix all relevant foreign references known to the author have

estimates for a given

a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic
loads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic mach
numbers .
  an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlating
airfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over a 45
sweptback wing in the mach number range from 0.50 to 0.95 at a
free-stream reynolds number of approximately 2 million .
the wing had an aspect ratio
of 5.5, a taper ratio of 0.53, naca 64a010 sections normal to the
quarterchord line, and was mounted on a slender body of revolution .
  at mach numbers of 0.85 and below, and for wing normal-force
coefficients below the maximum normal-force coefficient for an
infinite-aspect-ratio wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil section
data by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over most
of the wing between wing-section and two-dimensional-airfoil pressure
distributions .  for greater normal-force coefficients lateral
boundary-layer flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximum
section normal-force coefficients .  the effectiveness of this lateral
boundary-layer flow disappeared towards the tip .  for all mach numbers,
the influence of plan-form effects on the pressure distributions limited
the quality of the correlation at the 20- and 95-percent-semispan
stations .  above a mach number of about 0.85 the shock waves
originating at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread over
the span, preventing further application of two-dimensional data .
  the spanwise load distributions at moderate normal-force coefficients
could be predicted from span-loading theory for the entire mach number
range of the tests .

the applications of the polygon method to the calculation

  this paper sets out the method now used by the author of
applying the polygon method to the calculation of the compressible
subsonic flow round two-dimensional aerofoils .  tables have been
constructed which can be used for all aerofoil shapes, putting the
polygon method on the same footing numerically as goldstein's
method has the advantage over approximation 3 that it can be applied in
the following cases which are beyond the scope of goldstein's method ..
conventional aerofoils, (b) the low-speed flow about very thick
aerofoils, e.g., in reference 3 it is applied to circular cylinders, (c)
the flow about symmetric aerofoils between either straight or constant
pressure walls, (d) flow in asymmetric channels,
and (e) more difficult problems
of the flow about aerofoils in the presence
of one or two constraining
walls (to be published) .  a method of
calculating lift and moment
coefficients, and their rates of change
with incidence (a) is also
given in the paper .
  as an example the velocity distribution and the rates of
change of the lift and moment coefficients with a are calculated for
the aerofoil r.a.e.104 at values of m (mach number at infinity) of 0,
and 0.7, for various values of the incidence, a .  the velocity
distributions for zero incidence are found to be in fair agreement with
the corresponding experimental results .  the results at incidence are
in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, not for the
same incidence, but for the same lift coefficient .  it is found, for
example, that at m = 0.7 the theory for a = 0.8 agrees best
with experiment for a = 1.0, when the lift coefficients are
approximately the same .

laminar boundary layer oscillations and transition
on a flat plate .
  this is an account of an investigation in which oscillations
were discovered in the laminar boundary layer along a flat plate .
these oscillations were found during the course of an experiment
in which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was being
studied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream was
being reduced to unusually low values by means of damping
screens .  the first part of the paper deals with experimental
methods and apparatus, measurements of turbulence and
sound, and studies of transition .  a description is then given
of the manner in which oscillations were discovered and how
they were found to be related to transition, and then how
controlled oscillations were produced and studied in detail .  the
oscillations are shown to be the velocity variations
accompanying a wave motion in the boundary layer, this wave motion having
all the characteristics predicted by a stability theory based on
the exponential growth of small disturbances .  a review of this
theory is given .  the work is thus experimental confirmation
of a mathematical theory of stability which had been in the
process of development for a period of approximately 40 years,
mainly by german investigators .

the hall effect in the viscous flow of ionized gas
between parallel plates under transverse magnetic field .
  the electrical conductivity of an ionized
gas is anisotropic in the
presence of magnetic field (hall effect) .
the conductivity is expressed by
a tensor in the same form for both fully
and partially ionized gases .  by
the use of modified ohm's law and
conventional magnetohydrodynamical
equations the incompressible viscous
flow between parallel plates under
the transverse magnetic field is analyzed
and an exact solution is obtained
when the magnetic reynolds number
is small .  the numerical results
reveal a remarkable effect of anisotropy
of conductivity .  the acceleration
and deceleration of viscous ionized
gas under combined electric and
magnetic fields are also calculated .

boundary layer induced noise in the interior of aircraft .
  at high speeds the turbulent boundary layer washing the
airplane fuselage excites appreciable skin vibration, promoting strong
noise in the interior .  the fluctuating exciting pressure distribution
can be represented as a pattern of moving waves (fourier integral) .
a running ripple in the skin follows underneath each wave, and the noise
is ultimately due to these ripples .
  the acoustic effects of the running ripples are calculated
for an infinite sheet,. this is considered the main result of the
paper .  supersonically moving ripples radiate strong sound in the form
of mach waves,. subsonically moving ripples radiate no sound .  formulas
for the mean square surface pressure and the energy flux are obtained
for an assumed idealized turbulent pressure spectrum .
  the results are adapted to provide a tentative estimate of
the noise generated at subsonic speeds in a practical fuselage .  the
running ripples are almost noise-free, but multiple reflections at the
frames and stringers promote standing waves .  an assumption is used
to link the two kinds of waves, and this leads to provisional
calculations of noise level ..  on this basis the noise level is
predicted to vary as for thin boundary layers, changing
progressively to for thick layers ( = external air
density, = speed, = layer thickness, = panel thickness) .  some
comparisons are made with experiment .  finally, an idea for
minimizing the noise is presented .

propeller in yaw .
  it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw
develops a side force like that of a fin .  in 1917, r. g. harris
expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the
unyawed propeller .  of several attempts to express the side
force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none
has been completely satisfactory .  an analysis that
incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work
and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide
range of operating conditions is presented herein .  the present
analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form
of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may
be taken as the projected side area of the propeller .  the
effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic
pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by
the inflow .  the variation of the inflow velocity, for a
fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force
with advance-diameter ratio v nd .
  the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are
also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching
velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the
exception of the spin .
  further conclusions are ..  a dual-rotating propeller in yaw
develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating
propeller .  a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a
pitching moment in addition to the side force .  the pitching
moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal
to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the
propeller radius .  this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw
is small but possibly not negligible .
  the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the
exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of
charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been
presented without derivation in an earlier report .

effect of slight blunting of leading edge of an immersed
body on the flow around it at hypersonic speed .
  manufacturing and maintainance of ideally sharp leading edges
and noses is practically impossible, hence a discrepancy arises
between the theory established for sharp edges and actual flow
around slightly blunted edges, where a detached shock is formed
with a subsonic adjacent region .  semi-empirical method is worked
out showing that the pressure distribution in the vicinity of the
leading edge is the same for different thin profiles having the same
shape of bluntness on their edges or noses .  the data for a flat
plate can be used for all of them .  for moderate supersonic speed
the pressure on the remaining body is practically unaffected by the
nose bluntness, and can be computed from a sharp-edge theory .
for high supersonic speed a slight blunting of the edge can
considerably alter the pattern of flow over a large region .  the method
consists in replacing blunted edge by action of concentrated
forces on the flow,. it is applied to blunted wedge where it shows
doubling of the drag computed by classic theory, and to cones,
where the drag of a blunted cone may become smaller than that of
a sharp one .

theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic
turbines .
  in special circumstances where a large work
output is required from a turbine in a single stage
it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the
nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at
inlet to the rotor .  as part of an investigation into such
turbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of
the rotor have been tested in a two-dimensional tunnel,
a design theory being developed concurrently .
  the first design, featuring constant passage width
and curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having
thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from
focusing of the compression waves from the concave
surface, with consequent flow separation from the
opposite convex surface .  it gave a velocity coefficient of
measured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning
angle of 140 deg .  the measured value compares favourably
with values from previous steam tests, where the
results have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92 .
  from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test
observations, a subsequent passage was designed
having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading
to a free-vortex passage of double the transition
curvature,. a small amount of contraction was incorporated .
schlieren photographs showed the flow in this
passage to be almost shock free .  a thin region of low-energy
air existed close to the convex surface, but
liquid-injection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow .
pressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity
coefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressure .
when allowance is made for turning angle and
reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably
with previous work .
  it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine
would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a
two-dimensional cascade .  however, the resultant pitching
tends to become very close, except at very large
turning angles, with the result that in some applications
difficulties could arise in the practical design and
manufacture .
  several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded
as still experimental .

the performance of supersonic turbine nozzles .
  an investigation has been conducted
at the national gas turbine establishment into the
performance of turbines having high pressure ratios
per stage .  the present report discusses the mode of
operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines,
and describes a cascade experiment .  both theory and
experiment demonstrate that the conditions imposed
upon the supersonic flow immediately downstream
of the nozzles (e.g., by a following row of rotor blades)
exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outlet
flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure
ratio obtainable across the nozzle--providing that the
axial component of velocity is subsonic .  this is an
important difference from the more familiar flow of
subsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, the
downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the
nozzle blade shape and spacing .  a suitable test technique
using a closed-jet tunnel is demonstrated .
  the particular nozzles tested, of convergent-divergent
form, had a straight-sided divergent portion of
to axial direction) and a design mach number of 2 .
the flow was found to be well behaved as regards shock
pattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressure
ratios tested--between 9 1 and 19 1 .  in particular the
efficiency at the design pressure ratio of 16.6 1 was
high, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses of
pitot and static tubes being 0.98 .
  for the conversion of pitot to total pressure at a mach
number of 2.5 a high accuracy is important in the
measurement of the static pressure,. nevertheless readings
from a conventional four-hole instrument appear to
be reliable .

on the testing of supersonic compressor cascades .
  to facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors,
an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring blade
performance in a stationary cascade at supersonic speeds .  a suitable
technique was developed and the losses in a variety of cascades were
measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any
possible application .  it was concluded that if a useful compressor is
to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to
the existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, and
thus a new approach is necessary .
  some of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonic
speeds are discussed in the light of the current understanding of the
mode of operation of supersonic compressors at transonic speeds .

the supersonic axial flow compressor .
  an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of
axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into
the blade rows .  preliminary calculations showed that very
high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat
increased mass flows, were apparently possible with
compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their
blading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has been
reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient
supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound .
the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the
essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow
compressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,
large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which
extend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade
is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely
eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no
reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient
is apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the
compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as
to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is
proposed .
  as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three
possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of
the encouraging results of this study, an experimental
single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in
freon-12 .  in this compressor, air decelerates through the
speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at
subsonic speeds .  a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency
of about 80 percent has been obtained .

necessary on the nozzle shape effect, in general, no essential
limitation on the conventional nozzles .  the method is applicable
throughout the entire speed range,. the velocity of sound itself
plays no singular part .  the principal weight is placed on the
treatment of the flow near the throat of a converging-diverging

  the intensity of turbulence, the longitudinal and lateral
correlation coefficients, and the spectra of turbulence in a 3.5
inch-diameter free jet were measured with hot-wire anemometers at
exit mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.7 and reynolds numbers from
  the results of these measurements show the following ..  (1)
near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream
of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent
of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately
increasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greater
than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the
maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until
the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching
similarity .  (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of
turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number
and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with
distance from the jet nozzle .  (3) farther downstream of the
jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases
approximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle the
lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not
vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal
scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about
mum moves out from the centerline .  (6) a statistical analysis
of the correlograms and spectra yields a /scale/ which, although
different in magnitude from the conventional, varies similarly
to the ordinary scale and is easier to evaluate .

on the strength distribution of noise sources along
a jet .
  the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is
investigated by application of lighthill's
theory to regions of 'similar'
profiles .  the analysis refers to the
noise power emitted by a 'slice' of
jet (section between two adjacent planes
normal to the axis) as a function
of distance x of the slice from the nozzle .
it is found that this power
is essentially constant with x in the initial
mixing region (x law), then
further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters
from the nozzle) falls off
extremely fast (x law or faster) in the
fully developed jet .  because
of this striking attenuation of strength
with distance, it is concluded that
the mixing region produces the bulk of
the noise and must dominate in
muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat'
part of the jet must contribute
much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed .
  powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity
profile on total noise power are interpreted
qualitatively .  the behavior of
multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers,
both as to overall quieting and
frequency-shifting, is also interpreted
in the light of the results .  the
possibility emerges that such mufflers
may be improved without serious
thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .

elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds .
  to help fill the gap in the knowledge
of aerodynamics of shapes
intermediate between bodies of revolution
and flat triangular wings, force
and moment characteristics for elliptic
cones have been experimentally
determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and
sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6
and with lengths and base areas
equal to circular cones of fineness
ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied
for angles of bank of 0 and 90 .
elliptic and circular cones in
combination with triangular wings of aspect
ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been
considered .  the angle-of-attack range
was from 0 to about 16, and the
reynolds number was 8x10, based on
model length .  in addition to the
forces and moments at angle of attack,
pressure distributions for elliptic
cones at zero angle of attack have been determined .
  the results of this investigation
indicate that there are distinct
aerodynamic advantages to the use of
elliptic cones .  with their major
cross-sectional axes horizontal, they
develop greater lift and have higher
lift-drag ratios than circular cones
of the same fineness ratio and volume .
in combination with triangular wings
of low aspect ratio, they also develop
higher lift-drag ratios than circular
cones with the same wings .  for
winged elliptic cones, this increase
in lift-drag ratio results both from
lower zero-lift drag and drag due to
lift .  visual-flow studies indicate
that, because of better streamlining
in the crossflow plane, vortex flow
is inhibited more for an elliptic cone
with major axis in the plane of the
wing than for a circular cone with the
same wing .  as a result, vortex
drag resulting from lift is reduced .
shifts in center of pressure with
changes in angle of attack and mach
number are small and about the same
as for circular cones .
  comparisons of theoretical and
experimental force and moment
characteristics for elliptic cones indicate
that simple linearized (flat plate)
wing theory is generally adequate even
for relatively thick cones .
zero-lift pressure distributions and drag
can be computed using van dyke's
second-order slender-body theory .
for winged circular cones, a
modification of the slender-body theory of
naca rep. 962 results in good agreement
of theory with experiment .

a technique for improving the predictions of linearised
theory on the drag of straight edge wings .
  the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings,
calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displays
discontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edges
are sonic .  these features, which are not observed in practice, are due
to the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure along
a subsonic or sonic edge .  it is shown that if the linearised equation
of supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edged
wings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the full
placed by plausible values .  on this basis a simple method is derived
for improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edged
wings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental results .
  while the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, an
artifice renders them amenable to similar treatment .

  the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces of a

cruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analysed using the slender body
theory .  the system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and,
in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect to
the main wings .
  the method is a development of that used by owen and maskell in

  simple expressions to determine the strengths and positions of
the trailing vortices (supposed to be rolled-up) downstream of the main
wings are given, and from them the forces on the tail are deduced .
when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exact
solution is obtained from slender body theory ..  but for rectangular
tail surfaces of moderate or high aspect ratio, it is suggested that the
changes in lift and sideforce on the tail caused by the wing vortex
field can be estimated approximately from the mean upwash and sidewash
angles evaluated over the respective tail spans .  formulae for these

interference between the wings and tail plane of a

  an approximate method of predicting the interference between
the wings and the tailplane of a slender wing-body-tailplane

in centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found to
occur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weapons .  incidence
changes in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wings
and the tail surfaces, have been considered .
  the method is based on slender body theory and the assumption
that the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reach

low aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaces .  when
the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, an
analytical solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on
the tail lift .  for high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces it

may be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwash
angle across the tail span .

accuracy of approximate methods for predicting pressure
on pointed non-lifting bodies of revolution in supersonic
flow .
  the accuracy and range of applicability of the linearized theory,
second-order theory, tangent-cone method, conical-shock-expansion theory
and newtonian theory for predicting pressure distributions on pointed
bodies of revolution at zero angle of
attack are investigated .  pressure
distributions and integrated pressure
drag obtained by these methods are
compared with standard values obtained
by the method of characteristics
and the theory of taylor and maccoll .
three shapes, cone, ogive, and a
modified optimum body, are investigated
over a wide range of fineness
ratios and mach numbers .
  it is found that the linearized
theory is accurate only at low values
of the hypersonic similarity parameter
number to body fineness ratio) and that
second-order theory appreciably
extends the range of accurate application .
the second-order theory gives
good results on ogives when the ratio of
the tangent of maximum surface
angle to the tangent of the mach angle
is less than 0.9 .  tangent-cone
method cannot be widely applied with
good accuracy .  in general, the
conical-shock-expansion theory predicts
pressure and drag within
engineering accuracy when the hypersonic similarity
parameter is greater than 1.2 .
although newtonian theory gives good accuracy,
except for cones, at the
highest values of the hypersonic similarity
parameter investigated, it is
less accurate than the conical-shock-expansion theory .

theorem is established, and the concept of the interference
effect of a forebody on an afterbody is introduced .
  the theories are applied to bodies whose profiles are either
straight or parabolic arcs, formulae and curves being
given for forebody and afterbody drag, and for the interference

a second order shock-expansion method applicable to
bodies of revolution near zero lift .
  a second-order shock-expansion
method applicable to bodies of
revolution near zero lift is developed .
expressions defining the pressures on
noninclined bodies are derived by the
use of characteristics theory in
combination with properties of the flow
predicted by the generalized
shock-expansion method .  this result is
extended to inclined bodies to
obtain expressions for the normal-force
and pitching-moment derivatives
at zero angle of attack .  the method is
intended for application under
conditions between the ranges of applicability
of the second-order
potential theory and the generalized shock-expansion
mehtod - namely, when the
ratio of free-stream mach number to nose fineness
ratio is in the
neighborhood of 1 .
  for noninclined bodies, the pressure
distributions predicted by the
second-order shock-expansion method are
compared with existing experimental
results and with predictions of other
theories .  for inclined bodies, the
normal-force derivatives and locations
of the center of pressure at zero
angle of attack predicted by the method
are compared with experimental
results for mach numbers from 3.00 to 6.28 .
fineness ratio 7, 5, and 3
cones and tangent ogives were tested alone
and with cylindrical afterbodies
up to 10 diameters long .  in general, the
predictions of the present method
are found to be in good agreement with the
experimental results .  for
non-inclined bodies, pressure distributions
predicted with the method are in
good agreement with existing experimental
results and with distributions
obtained with the method of characteristics .
for inclined bodies, the
normal-force derivatives per radian (for
normal-force coefficients
referenced to body base area) are predicted
within 0.2 and the locations of
the center of pressure are predicted
within 0.2 body diameters .  on the
basis of these results, the
second-order shock-expansion method appears
applicable for values of the ratio
of free-stream mach number to nose
fineness ratio from 0.4 to 2 .

  a fourier analysis of the linearised theory expression for the

to derive the area distribution which
minimises the expression for given

minimal deduced from this by relaxing
the restriction on volume is used to
evolve a method for the numerical
evaluation of the original expression .

transonic speeds .  the second is in the
calculation of the wave drag of

criteria for thermodynamic equilibrium in gas flow .
  when gases flow at high velocity, the rates
of internal processes may not be fast enough to
maintain thermodynamic equilibrium .  by defining
quasi-equilibrium in flow as the condition in which
the temperature, pressure, density, and velocity
deviate by less than a fixed, small percentage from
what they would be if the flowing gas could actually
be in thermodynamic equilibrium, criteria are
derived for determining whether quasi-equilibrium
is a stable condition in the flow .  by use of
excitation of molecular vibration as an example, the
general properties of criteria curves are discussed and
interpreted .  a discussion is given of how to use
these results to determine definitely whether a flow
is or is not in thermodynamic equilibrium .
applications to dissociating gases, to mixtures, and to
the phenomenon of /choking/ in a laval nozzle
are given special consideration .  for cases when
application of the criteria predict nonequilibrium,
equations are provided in a form useful for
numerical forward integration along streamlines .

a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow .
    the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressure
viscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosed
region of low-velocity air (/dead air/) . the law of conservation of
energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the
separated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid
surface . this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations in

of the case where air is injected into the separated region  .

all calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness at
the position of separation .

at arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocity
profiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes place .
results are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1
and 10  . the rate of heat transfer to a separated laminar region in air

of gas into the separated region is calculated to have a powerful effect

an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation
of airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high
reynolds numbers .
and rapid method by which boundary
layer flow was rendered visible has been
previously described in the journal of the royal
aeronautical society .  it gave promise of
being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided
a denser smoke could be obtained, which at
the same time was free from the troublesome deposits
associated with the wood smoke .
of the aerodynamics division attempts were made
by the fuel research station to improve the
density of the wood smoke and to reduce the
deposits .  these they showed were conflicting
requirements, and whilst some improvement
was effected, it was not sufficient for observation
in the new tunnels at high speeds .
  the staff of the director-general of scientific
research and development, ministry of supply,
was then approached and it was decided to
develop an oil smoke generator from a simple
generator of this type which was demonstrated
to us .  this has been done successfully .
the final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke
generator is light and compact .  it takes
only a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired .
improvement on the wood smoke both as regards
density and freedom from deposits, which cause
premature transition .  the density and quality
of the smoke are now under control .  smokes
ranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour
to a heavy smoke dense white in appearance
can be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the
advantages of the wood smoke in that it is
non-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be
tolerated even when it is present in a considerable
concentration .  a certain amount of condensation
is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable
precautions troubles arising from this can be
avoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a
hard wax was successfully generated with the
same apparatus .  unfortunately because of its
flocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid
deposits when passed through bore tubing,
leading eventually to complete blockage .  this
seems to be a feature of solid smokes .
  the apparatus has been used to determine
transition and laminar separation points on model
wings in a number of the national physical
laboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been
maintained in the laminar state up to wind
speeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .
  there is much to be said for making a standard
practice of visualising boundary layer flow on
models, particularly as the technique is simple and
rapid .  it would greatly assist the
interpretation of force measurements and the more detailed
explorations of the boundary layer by total
head tubes and hot wires .
  the use of oil smoke is not limited to
boundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus
described in this report would seem to be
particularly suited for educational work in small
demonstration tunnels .

the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimensions .
  this paper presents the results of the first part of an
experimental investigation of the ground effect on simple jet flap
aerofoils .  in this part of the work an aerofoil having a 58.1 deg jet
flap was tested under two-dimensional conditions .
  the pressure lift on the aerofoil was measured, with the ground
at fixed positions, for varying jet momentum coefficients .  it was
found that the effect of the ground on the pressure lift was very small
up to a certain critical jet coefficient .  on increasing the jet
coefficient beyond the critical value a marked loss of pressure lift was
observed .  this critical value referred to is approximately the same as
the jet coefficient at which the jet first hits the ground .
  some significant, though highly tentative comments, are made
regarding the practical application of this work to the take-off
characteristics of a jet flapped aircraft .

an investigation of interference effects on similar models of

details are given of a programme of tests being made on similar
swept-wing models in transonic tunnels of different types .  force measurement
results at subsonic speeds in the r.a.e. 3 ft. by 3 ft. slotted tunnel
show only small interference effects for models of moderate blockage
at low incidence., at higher incidences, the interference effect on
lift becomes appreciably greater than estimated by theory, and
significant pitching moment differences occur, apparently due to wall
interference on the wing flow field .  comparable but smaller effects
are evident in the results from the a.r.a. 9 ft. by 8 ft. perforated
tunnel .  at speeds just above m = 1, the force fluctuates as speed
is increased, because of wave reflection interference .  the magnitude
of the fluctuations diminishes as speed is further increased and this
reduction is more marked in the perforated tunnel .  pressure
measurements along the top of the body at zero incidence show delay in
shock movements at high subsonic speeds indicating a blockage effect
on speed., the effect is larger in the perforated tunnel though
smaller than predicted by theory .  above m = 1, both expansion and
shock waves are strongly reflected in the slotted tunnel but
considerable alleviation, particularly of shock waves, is achieved
in the perforated tunnel, for which an analysis of the effects is

  the whitham-walkden theory for the estimation of the strength
of shock waves at ground level from aircraft flying at supersonic

transport aeroplane .
  if a figure of 2 lb sq.ft. (including a factor of 2 for ground
reflection) is taken as an upper limit for the acceptable strength of
the bow wave from such an aircraft it is shown that restrictions on
the climb and flight plan will be involved .  the advantage of the
employment of larger engines with or without afterburning is discussed,
with reference also to the penalties involved owing to the increase in
weight of the aircraft and its direct operating costs .
  finally it is suggested that an aircraft of given volume could be
designed, by suitable choice of thickness and lift distribution, to
minimise the strength of the shock waves in the far field .

an approximate solution of the turbulent boundary layer
equations in incompressible and compressible .
  if over the 'outer region' of the boundary layer, where the mean
velocity varies but little from its value outside the shear layer, a
virtual eddy viscosity is defined, which is constant over the outer
region but varies in the direction of the mainstream, a solution of the
turbulent boundary layer equations can be found which satisfies the
appropriate boundary conditions .  the solution leads to a compatibility
condition for the virtual eddy viscosity in terms of the wall shear
stress, the boundary layer momentum thickness and the mainstream
velocity, at least for the case of a constant external velocity .  this
compatibility condition, which can be expressed as
for moderate to high reynolds numbers, where is the shear velocity,
is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic)
viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for the
equilibrium of the large eddies .  the numerical value of the constant
derived by townsend agrees with ours for reynolds numbers (based on x)
of about .  with this relation for an equation, analoguous to the

an experimental study of the glancing interaction between
a shock wave and a turbulent boundary layer .
  an experimental study has been made at mach numbers from 1.6 to 2.0 of
the interaction between the turbulent
boundary layer on a side wall of a wind
tunnel and the shock wave produced by
a plate mounted on the wall .  under
these conditions the shock wave boundary
layer interaction was three
dimensional at least over the region
investigated (up to 10 boundary layer
thicknesses from the plate) .  it was
found that the boundary layer was
separated by a shock wave of strength
type occur on the sides of fuselages at
the wing fuselage junction and may
therefore be important with regard to the

on turbulen flow between parallel plates .
  the reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow of
incompressible fluid have been studied for turbulent
flow between parallel plates .  the number of these
equations is finally reduced to two .  one of these consists of
mean velocity and correlation between transverse and
longitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations only .
the other consists of the mean pressure and transverse
turbulent-velocity intensity .  some conclusions about
the mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuations
are drawn .  these equations are applied to two special
cases ..  one is poiseuille flow in which both plates are
at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at
rest and the other is moving with constant velocity .  the
mean velocity distribution and the correlation can
be expressed in a form of polynomial of the co-ordinate in
the direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratio
of shearing stress on the plate to that of the corresponding
laminar flow of the same maximum velocity as a
parameter .  these expressions hold true all the way across the
plates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layer
including the laminar sublayer .  these expressions for
poiseuille flow have been checked with experimental data
of laufer fairly well .  it also shows that the logarithmic
mean velocity distribution is not a rigorous solution of
reynolds equations .

experiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers along
a long cylinder in incompressible flow .
  experiments on axi-symmetric boundary
layers along a long cylinder were made
especially to investigate the effect of transverse
curvature on the velocity profile .  laminar
velocity profiles were measured and compared
with theoretical ones with good accuracy .
a representative profile was plotted to see the
effect of transverse curvature, which showed
small, but obvious effect accompanied by
increasing skin friction .
  the transition of the flow from laminar to
turbulent was observed, and its reynolds
number was estimated to occur at 1.2 1.8x10
in the present experiment .  the turbulent
profile was also measured and plotted by using
the coordinates to express the wall law
deduced by richmond, from which it was
estimated that, as the ratio of the momentum
thickness to body radius increases, the profile
near the outer layer tends to bend down
relative to the line of logarithmic wall law .

.W
the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion .
this paper was written early in 1941
and circulated to the civil defence research
committee of the ministry of home security
in june of that year .  the present writer
had been told that it might be possible
to produce a bomb in which a very large
amount of energy would be released by
nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had
not then been used--and the work here
described represents his first attempt to form
an idea of what mechanical effects might
be expected if such an explosion could occur .
in the then common explosive bomb mechanical
effects were produced by the sudden
generation of a large amount of gas at a high
temperature in a confined space .  the
practical question which required an answer
was ..  would similar effects be produced
if energy could be released in a highly
concentrated form unaccompanied by the
generation of gas .qm  this paper has now
been declassified, and though it has been
superseded by more complete calculations,
it seems appropriate to publish it as it was
first written, without alteration, except for
the omission of a few lines, the addition of
this summary, and a comparison with some
more recent experimental work, so that
the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated .
  an ideal problem is here discussed .  a finite
amount of energy is suddenly released
in an infinitely concentrated form .  the motion
and pressure of the surrounding air is
calculated .  it is found that a spherical shock
wave is propagated outwards whose
radius r is related to the time t since the explosion
started by the equation
where is the atmospheric density, e is
the energy released and s a calculated
function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air .
  the effect of the explosion is to force most
of the air within the shock front into a
thin shell just inside that front .  as the front
expands, the maximum pressure
decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases
to be accurate .  at 20 atm. 45 of
the energy has been degraded into heat which is
not available for doing work and used
up in expanding against atmospheric pressure .
this leads to the prediction that an
atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as
a blast-producer, as a high explosive
releasing the same amount of energy .
  in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is
proportional to r, and comparison
with the measured pressures near high explosives,
in the range of radii where the two
might be expected to be comparable, shows that
these conclusions are borne out by
experiment .

cylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energy

  taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosion
has been extended to the cylindrical case .  it is found
that the radius r of a strong cylindrical shock wave
produced by a sudden release of energy e per unit length
grows with time t according to the equation
where is the atmospheric density and
is a calculated function of the specific
heat ratio .  for is found to be approximately
unity .  for this case, the pressure behind the
shock wave decays with radius r according to the relation .
applying the results of this analysis
to the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown that
the shock envelope behind a meteor or a high-speed
missile is approximately a paraboloid given by
where d and v denote the total
drag and the velocity of the missile, respectively,
and x is the distance behind the missile .

exact solution of the neumann problem . calculation
for non- circulatory plane and axially symmetric flows
about or within arbitrary boundaries .
  an exact general method of solving
the neumann or second boundary-value
problem has been developed and has been
applied to the calculation of
low-speed flows about or within bodies of
almost any shape, provided the flow is
either plane or has axial symmetry .
solid-body, inlet, and purely internal
flow problems can be solved .  the
method is capable of dealing with several
bodies at once in the presence of
one another, and consequently interference
problems can be treated with ease .
boundaries need not be solid, that is,
flows involving area suction can be
calculated .  velocities can be computed
not only for points on the surface of
the body but for the entire flow field .
  a surface source distribution is
used as a basis for solution .  this
leads to a fredholm integral equation
of the second kind, which is solved as
a set of linear algebraic equations,
usually by a modified seidel method .
at the present time the solution is
programed on the ibm 704 edpm to solve
the flow about any body that has the
previously mentioned characteristics
and whose profile can be defined
satisfactorily by no more than 300
coordinate points .  a number of solutions
are presented, to show both the scope
of the method and its accuracy .
computations require from three minutes
to two hours, depending upon the
shape of the body and the number of points
used to define it .

it is found that similar solutions for

expressions for velocity, temperature,

it is found that the effect of the
magnetic field is to decrease the rate of
heat transfer from the wall .  in the
second part, the method of characteristics
is employed to obtain solutions of
the time-dependent hydromagnetic free
convection equations (hyperbolic) of

the influence of transverse magnetic fields on
the laminar free-convection flow of liquid
metals over a vertical flat plate and between

specific wall temperature variations and
prandtl numbers .  the extent of influence on
the flow and temperature fields is determined
by the magnitude of a nondimensional
influence parameter which is the ratio of the
magnetic force to the buoyant force .  in
general, increasing the magnetic field strength
decreases the magnitude of the velocity, wall

increases the temperature throughout the fluid .

  combined free and forced convective heat
transfer in vertical channels has been studied by many
researchers .  due to the need for engineering design
information there have been many papers concerning
cases of fully developed flow with varying wall
temperature .  forced flows in a channel of electrically
conducting fluid with a transverse magnetic field
have been studied and the large effects of a magnetic
field on the flow pattern have been established .
  flows of combined free and forced convection in
electrically conducting fluids in vertical channels
with a transverse magnetic field are expected to
attract attention in future engineering applications, for
example, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or in
plasma studies .  however, except for a report by
gershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning a
particular case, no general study has been published .
  this paper is a general treatment of fully
developed, free and forced convective, laminar,
magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with a
transverse magnetic field .  it includes combined free and
forced convective flows in channels without a
magnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. as
special cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in the
other limit .

oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic
hypersonic strip theory .
  the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for
conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the
shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled
boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .
  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and
roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .
transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on
the model surface .
  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a
hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the
entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties and a distance along the body
surface from the stagnation point) .
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds
number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the
hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .

analysis of quartz and teflon shields for a particular

  the transient performance of
ablation type heat protection shields is
treated herein for the surface of
a vehicle returning from outer space to the
earth .  the vehicle weighs 8640 kg,
has a ballistic factor of 500 lb ft,
re-enters with a speed of 11 km sec at
ratio of 0.5, and is subjected to a
maximum deceleration of 7.7 times the
gravity constant .
  by use of well known equations
for the heat transfer and the mass
transfer at a heated surface, a numerical
calculation method is derived which, for
the investigated ablation processes,
yields exact transient solutions of the
fundamental system of partial differential
equations .  the method is applied
to various quartz shields and to one
teflon shield, which all evaporate so
readily under the conditions of the
problem at hand that practically no flow
of molten shield material exists .
the solutions also show comparatively small
temperature changes parallel to the surface .
  the results show that the nose
of the vehicle is cooled predominantly by
the evaporation of the quartz or the
teflon,. the rest of the vehicle's surface
is cooled by radiation of the quartz
or evaporation of the teflon .  the large
mass transfer effects on the nose of
the vehicle are detrimental since the
resulting low surface temperatures prevent
the radiative heat transfer out of
the shield, which does not involve any
mass loss, from being the desirable
governing cooling factor .

reaction tests of turbine nozzles for supersonic velocities .
  a machine for testing turbine nozzles by the reaction
method, which was described in a previous paper, was
used to test a series of convergent-divergent turbine
nozzles .  the results of these tests, along with the test
of a convergent turbine nozzle, are compared with each
other and with analytical values .  two kinds of analytical
values are employed, namely, the usual values obtained
from an assumed isentropic expansion from inlet state to
exhaust pressure, and the values obtained from the
assumption that the processes in the nozzle are isentropic
except for a normal shock which takes up a position in the
nozzle such as to cause the stream to fill the exit area at
the exhaust pressure whenever possible .  this latter kind
of analytical value involves no shock when the exit area can
be filled at the exhaust pressure by means of isentropic
processes only, or when the exhaust pressure is lowered
so far that the shock has passed out of the passage .  the
agreement of the test results with the calculated results
of this latter kind is good, and the disagreement which
exists can be attributed largely to separation at the shock
and to transmission of exhaust-pressure effects upstream
through the boundary layer .

study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exit
of two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor blades
at critical and supercritical pressure ratios .
  an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream of a
cascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical
pressure ratios .  the results of five theoretical methods for
determining the deflection angle are compared with those of an experimental
method using the conservation-of-momentum principle and
static-pressure surveys, and also are compared with an analysis of
schlieren photographs of the flow downstream of the blades .  a two-
dimensional cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 inches
was used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the
schlieren photographs .  in order to determine the flow conditions several
blade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs were
taken of the flow through a cascade of 18 blades having an axial
width of 0.60 inch .
  for the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressure
ratios considerably lower than that required to give critical
velocity at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangential
direction as predicted for the incompressible case .  as the pressure
ratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear
portion of the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant .
after this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of the
cascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that no
further increase in the amount of turning across the blade row and
no further increase in the loading of the blade was available .

on source and vortex distributions in the linearised
theory of steady supersonic flow .
  the hyperbolic character of the differential
equation satisfied by the velocity
potential in linearized supersonic flow entails
the presence of fractional infinities
in the fundamental solutions of the equation .
difficulties arising from this fact can
be overcome by the introduction of hadamard's
finite part of an infinite integral .
together with the definition of certain counterparts
of the familiar vector operators
this leads to a natural development of the analogy
between incompressible flow
and linearized supersonic flow .  in particular, formulae
are derived for the field of
flow due to an arbitrary distribution of supersonic
sources and vortices .
  applications to aerofoil theory, including the
calculation of the downwash in the
wake of an aerofoil, are given in a separate report (ref. 9) .

supersonic drag calculations for a cylindrical shell
wing of semicircular cross section combined with a
central body of revolution .
  a semi-circular ring wing with a body of revolution on
the axis is studied to find the wave and the vortex drag for
various chordwise lift distributions and for three values of
a parameter describing the wing geometry .  using the
wave drag obtained from the chordwise loading that gives the
least drag, together with the vortex and skin friction drags,
the maximum lift to drag ratio for each wing geometry is
computed .  compared to the estimates made by lomax and
heaslet, somewhat lower drags are found .

the surface oil flow technique as used in high speed
wind tunnels in the united kingdom .
  an examination has been made of the
various versions of the surface oil
flow technique used in different high speed
wind tunnels .  to provide
background information for this investigation
some systematic tests were made on
a simple model in a small supersonic tunnel .
the experience gained made it
possible to explain many of the variations
in terms of the different operating
conditions of the tunnels .
  the time taken to form a pattern
on a typical model is, to a first
approximation, directly proportional to
the value of the parameter,
the factor being 36,000 12,000 .  the
time taken appears to be independent
of the initial thickness of the oil sheet .
  a general procedure for the development
of oil mixtures for any purpose
is suggested .

jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodies
at mach 1. 91 and 3. 12 .
  data are presented which show the effect of a jet on base pressure
for a series of conical afterbody-jet-nozzle combinations having
boat-tail angles that varied from 0 to 11 and base-to-jet diameter ratios
that varied from 1.11 to 2.67 .  the jet nozzles had exit angles from 0
to 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 1.0 to 3.2 .
pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hot
numbers of 1.91 and 3.12 .
  in general, base pressure increased for increasing values of
boat-tail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure and
for decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number,
and free-stream mach number .  the addition of tail surfaces produced
only small changes in base pressure .
  for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximum
pressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of the
trailing shock .  the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jet
and free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by the
state of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzle .
  values of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst,
page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values for
convergent nozzles .

laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated
air .
  a method of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt,
highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated
air flow is developed .  attention is restricted to the case of
axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional
bodies could be treated the same way .  the method is based on
the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the
ideas used by fay and riddell .  a simple formula is given for
predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point
rate .  it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution,
but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot
external flow, except at the stagnation point .
  experimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correct
stagnation-point simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are
also presented and compared with the theoretical predictions .
on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of
rapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity
assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the
actual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent .

some theoretical low-speed loading characteristics
of swept wings in roll and sideslip .
  the weissinger method for determining additional span
loading for incompressible flow is used to find the damping in
roll, the lateral center of pressure of the rolling load, and the
span loading coefficients caused by rolling for wing plan forms
of various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and sweep angles .  in
addition, the applicability of the method to the determination
of certain other aerodynamic derivatives is investigated, and
corrections for the first-order effects of compressibility are
indicated .
  the agreement obtained between experimentally and
theoretically determined values for the aerodynamic coefficients
indicates that the method of weissinger is well suited to the
calculation of the additional span loading caused by rolling
and for the calculation of such resulting aerodynamic
derivatives of wings as do not involve considerations of tip suction .

the rolling up of the trailing vortex sheet and its
effect on the downwash behind wings .
  the motion of the trailing vortices associated with a lifting wing
is investigated by theoretical and visual-flow methods for the
purpose of determining the proper vortex distribution to be used
for downwash calculations .  both subsonic and supersonic speeds
are considered in the analysis .
  it is found that the degree to which the vortices are rolled up
depends upon the distance behind the wing and upon the lift
coefficient, span loading, and aspect ratio of the wing .  while the
rolling up of the trailing vortices associated with high
aspect-ratio wings is of little practical importance, it is shown that, with
low-aspect-ratio wings, the trailing vortex sheet may become
essentially rolled up into two trailing vortex cores within a chord
length of the trailing edge .
  the downwash fields associated with the two limiting cases of
the flat vortex sheet and the fully rolled-up vortices are
investigated in detail for both subsonic and supersonic speeds .  the
intermediate case in which the rolling-up process is only partially
completed at the tail position is also discussed .

  a theoretical study is made of some cruciform-wing

basic ideas of this theory are reviewed and equations are
developed for the pressures, loadings, and forces on slender
cruciform wings and wing-body combinations .  the rolling-up of
the vortex sheet behind a slender cruciform wing is considered
at length and a numerical analysis is carried out using 40
vortices to calculate the wake shape at various distances behind
an equal-span cruciform wing at 45 bank .  analytical
expressions are developed for the corresponding positions of
the rolled-up vortex sheets using a 4-vortex approximation to
the wake, and these positions are compared with the positions
of the centroids of vorticity resulting from the numerical analysis .
the agreement is found to be remarkably good at all distances

presented for various distances behind a cruciform wing at 0

at which the upper two vortices pass between the lower two is

rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piece-wise
application of similar solutions .
  a method is presented for the rapid calculation of the
incompressible laminar boundary layer in an arbitrary flow around
either a two-dimensional or a rotationally-symmetrical body .
the solution is obtained without recourse to von karman's
momentum equation by means of a coarse step-by-step procedure
in which each segment of the velocity distribution is
approximated by one of the falkner-skan family of similar flows .
  solutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any other
one-parameter approximate method, and in certain cases the
solutions become exact .  in regions of accelerating velocity, the
accuracy appears to be very high .  in decelerating flows,
separation is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutions
that is, the method is conservative in contrast to the von
karman-pohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predict
separation that actually exists .
  the method is the most rapid hand procedure known to the
author, provided the full history of the boundary layer is
required .  if only a thickness such as is needed at one point on a
surface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature method .
but, if several values of or other properties along a surface are
required, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature method .
characteristically, only four steps are needed between the forward
stagnation point and the pressure peak .  once the
velocity-distribution data are available, each step in a two-dimensional
calculation requires about 5 minutes, using a slide rule .

investigations such as those of references 1-4 have concentrated
on this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trends
predicted by small-disturbance theory, that premature transition
can be found with cooling .  this phenomenon, commonly called
detail in references 2-5 .

data obtained on a cooled cone in a mach 4 wind tunnel .  the
model, a sharp-tip cone (included angle 13.5), was cooled by
liquid nitrogen to a temperature of -340 f .  the cooling
method and the data analysis are similar to that described in

an investigation of laminar transitional and turbulent
heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow .
  laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been
measured by means of the shrouded model technique .  the
reynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpy
ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5 .
two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model
which consisted of a spherically capped cone .
  the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic
boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the
conical portion of the model .  on the spherical portion the data
are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical
prediction .  some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to
the nose of the model .
  the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared
to two theories ..  (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is
based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account
the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate
reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/
conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with
the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more
accurate .
  for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily
modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional
heat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to
estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat
transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .
  the behavior of transition reynolds number based on
momentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative
agreement with recent shock-tube measurements .

notes on waves through gases at pressures small compared
with the magnetic pressure, with applications to upper
atmosphere aerodynamics .
most treatments of magnetohydrodynamic
waves have confined physical
interpretation to cases when the alfven velocity a
is small compared with the sound
velocity a .  here we consider the 'low-beta
situation', in which a is much
larger than a .  then, except for two modes with
wave velocity a the only possible
waves are longitudinal ones, propagated
unidirectionally along lines of magnetic
force with velocity a .  these can be
interpreted as sound waves, confined to
effectively rigid magnetic tubes of force .
hall-current effects do not alter these
conclusions (in contrast to the high-beta
situation), and finite conductivity
introduces only small dissipation .
  an application is made to the flow pattern
around a body moving through the
f layer of the ionosphere, where, although
neutral particles have a very large
mean free path, charged particles interact
electrostatically and, it is argued, may
be regarded as forming a continuous fluid
whose movement is independent of
that of the neutral particles .  a body moving
at satellite speed or below would
then excite the above-mentioned unidirectional
sound waves, but no waves at
much faster alfven velocity .  these considerations
suggest that its movement
would be accompanied by a v-shaped pattern of
electron density (figure 2),
which might be in part responsible for some
anomalous radar echoes that have
been reported .

on a particular class of similar solutions of the equations
of motion and energy of a viscous fluid .
  by introducing the similarity concept to the two-dimensional,
incompressible navier-stokes equations and energy equation, a
particular class of solutions is found .  two general types of flows
are considered ..  (1) laminar free convection--i.e., flows which
take place due to a body force--and (2) laminar forced
convection .
  for free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions are
obtained for two different power-law surface temperature
variations, and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutes a
new type of boundary problem .  results of numerical
integrations of the equations are compared with solutions of the similar
boundary-layer equations for free convection, and it is
demonstrated that a range of surface temperature variations exists for
which the boundary layer equations are no longer valid .
  for forced convection, it is shown that the use of similarity
transformations provides an alternate method of deriving the
ordinary differential equations for some well-known solutions,
such as couette and stagnation point flows .  solutions are
obtained for radial converging or diverging flows between plane
surfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrary
powers of the distance from the orgin .  results of numerical
integrations of the ordinary differential equations are presented
for prandtl numbers of 0.01 and 1.0 and for linear surface
temperature variations .  some rather surprising results are obtained
for diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealing
comparisons with results from boundary-layer theory are made .

first-order approach to a strong interaction problem

.W
first-order approach to a strong interaction problem
in hypersonic flow over an insulated flat plate .
  the present paper concerns with
the strong interaction phenomenon over an
insulated semi-infinite flat plate with a sharp
leading edge .  in particular the main interest
is in the consistent treatment in which the
boundary-layer solution may be joined
continuously with the inviscid solution regarding
flow variables including pressure, normal
velocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and density .
  it is shown that the behavior of the inviscid
solution may be consistent with that of the
boundary-layer solution to at least first-order
approximation that is correct to the order of,
where m is the mach
number of undisturbed flow, r the reynolds
number based on the distance from leading
edge and the ratio of specific heats .  then
the first-order boundary-layer problem is
formulated under such an external circumstance
and an attempt is made for arriving at the solution .
  actual calculations are carried out for both
cases of air and helium .  from the solution
it is found that the region in which the viscous
effect plays a significant role is ranged over
from 0 to a certain finite value of n, say n, in
terms of the similarity coordinate n in the
corresponding incompressible boundary layer .
the numerical results moreover indicate
that the induced pressure is considerably smaller
than the estimate of lees (7) obtained by
his approximate method in which the effect
of the first-order induced pressure on the
boundary layer is ignored and no survey of the
first-order boundary-layer equation is made .
the present results are also found to be in
excellent agreement with experimental data
recently obtained in helium flow by erickson (15) .

second approximation to laminar compressible boundary
layer on flat plate in slip flow .
  the first-order solution for the laminar compressible boundary-layer
flow over a flat plate at constant wall temperature is given .  the
effect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between the
boundary-layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into
consideration .  the solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zero
order, or continuum, solution .  no
assumptions regarding the prandtl
number or viscosity-temperature law need be made .  it is found that the
first-order solution gives a decrease in heat transfer and, for
supersonic flow, an increase in skin friction .
for subsonic flow there is no
first-order shear effect .  the change in heat transfer is due to slip
and the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero- and
first-order velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer .

an approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundary

  approximate formulae of the displacement thickness and the skin
friction of the hypersonic laminar boundary layer are derived by use of
von karman's integral method, assuming the heat-insulated wall, the
prandtl number of unity and chapman and rubesin's formula for the
variation of viscosity with temperature .
the results obtained are
compared with some exact solutions .
because of the good agreement, it
seems that these formulae are very useful .
  these formulae, together with the tangent-wedge-approximation, are
applied to the viscous flow over
slender bodies with a sufficiently sharp
leading edge .  as an example, the
pressure distribution over a flat plate
is calculated numerically over the
entire region of the surface .
comparison with other author's theoretical
results as well as experimental

on the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with

  the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat

is dealt with by karman-pohlhausen's
method in special cases when
suction or injection velocity proportional
to, especially
for the region of strong interaction between
the shock wave and the
boundary layer, were p is the pressure on
the plate and x is the
distance measured along the plate from its leading edge .
  several numerical examples are given,
which shows similar effects of
injection to those in the case of incompressible
flow that the injection
makes all the height of the shock wave,
the thickness of the boundary
layer and the pressure on the plate larger
than those in the case of no
injection .  on the contrary, in the case of
suction no remarkable change
both in the height of the shock wave and
the pressure on the plate can
be seen and only the velocity profile in
the boundary layer is affected
by the suction .

  the theory of the steady flow of a viscous compressible fluid

the inviscid layer between the shock wave and the boundary layer .
it is shown that similar solutions exist in this layer, analogously
to those found by li and nagamatsu in the boundary layer, and
that the two may be joined to give, allowing one minor

the flow in it with good accuracy .  the tangent wedge

a method for predicting the onset of buffeting and other separation
effects from wind tunnel tests on rigid models .
the method is based on the observation of the divergence that occurs in
the variation of mean static pressure at the trailing edge of an
aircraft wing at the critical stage in the development of boundary-layer
separation when its influence first spreads to the trailing edge and
thereby to the overall flow .
the significance of the trailing-edge pressure variations and their
connection with the effects that separation has on the mean and unsteady
 loads is discussed for various types of separation . good prediction
can be obtained from wind-tunnel tests, or warning provided in flight,
for low-speed separations and for shock-induced ones up to the stage at
which the shock wave reaches the trailing edge . related divergences in
wake width, lift coefficient, or shock position can also be used .
pressure measurements at other isolated points often indicate the type
of separation .
certain special considerations apply for swept wings .
the various flow changes that are considered are illustrated by
schlieren photographs and described in an appendix .

simplified method for determination of the critical
height of distributed roughness particles for boundary

  a simplified method has been devised for determination of the
critical height of three-dimensional roughness particles required to
promote premature transition of a laminar boundary layer on models of
airplanes or airplane components in a wind tunnel with zero heat
transfer .  a single equation is derived which relates the roughness height
to a reynolds number based on the roughness height and on local flow
conditions at the height of the roughness, and charts are presented
from which the critical roughness height can be easily obtained for
mach numbers from 0 to 5 .  a discussion of the use of these charts is
presented with consideration of various model configurations .
  the method has been applied to various types of configurations in
several wind-tunnel investigations conducted by the national advisory
committee for aeronautics at mach numbers up to 4, and in all cases
the calculated roughness height caused premature boundary-layer
transition for the range of test conditions .

scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds

.W
scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds
and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .
  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic
speeds arise from differences between the conditions
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in
how they behave after separation .  for turbulent
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly
as the reynolds number is changed and in many
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed
artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by
excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever
possible .
  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,
and the results obtained by using them are compared .
in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement
is found, and explanations can be advanced for
cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed
and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed
in interpreting the results obtained with transition
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner
wings) .
  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds
number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may
separate from very close to the leading edge .  under
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .
more research is needed before sound recommendations
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .
  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition
may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition
have been satisfactory .

non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gas .
the theory of an'ideal dissociating'gas developed by lighthill/1957/for
conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium is extended to non-equilibrium
conditions by postulating a simple rate equation for the dissociation
process/including the effects of recombination/ . this equation contains
 the'equilibrium'parameters of the lighthill theory plus a further
dissociation phenomena .
the behaviour of this gas is investigated in flow through a strong
normal shock wave and past a bluff body . the assumption is made that
the gas receives complete excitation of its rotational and vibrational
degrees of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to the
familiar rankine-hugoniot shock wave relations before dissociation
begins . the variation of the relevant thermodynamic variables
down-stream of this region is then computed in a few particular cases . the
method used in the latter case is an extension of the'newtonian'theory
of hypersonic inviscid flow . in particular, the case of a sphere is
treated in some detail . the variation of the shock shape and the
sphere diameter to the length scale of the dissociation process, is
exhibited for conditions extending from completely undissociated flow
to dissociated flow in thermal equilibrium . results would indicate
that significant and observable changes from the undissociated values
occur, although values for the non-equilibrium parameter are not, at
present, available .

solution for the laminar boundary layer near the stagnation point of a
sphere .  surface temperature is free-stream static and shock is
strong .  air is assumed calorically and thermally perfect with a
prandtl number of 0.72 and a dynamic viscosity directly
proportional to temperature .
  based on work of homann (zamm 16, p. 153, 1936) and lighthill
simultaneous differential equations for the velocity and
temperature profiles .  these are solved by numerical integration along a
normal to the surface using a digital computer .  results are
presented as functions of free-stream mach number, reynolds
number, and specific heat ratio .  as increases,
boundary-layer thickness is shown to decrease while shock stand-off
distance increases .  stand-off distance also decreases with increasing
and decreasing specific heat .  for constant and specific
heat ratio, the product of skin-friction coefficient and the square
root of decreases with increasing only approaching a
constant value at greater than 10,000 .
  reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gas
assumption for air .  author suggests that the effects of dissociation on
flow properties are accounted for by a proper choice of specific
heat ratio .  a consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction in
the cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification of
this approach .  the effect on transport properties could have been

various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied

various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied
gas flow .
  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous
aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and
at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free
path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer
theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .
  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to
define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of
continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental
evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a
model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this
model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in
detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a
reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .
  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes
of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/
class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .
for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the
shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully
viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer
are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the
navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given
by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer
class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes
equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock
structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary
conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/
conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an
infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened
sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this
case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying
conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,
and heat conduction .
  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes
equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for
both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions
of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow
problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to
illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations
have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the
assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful
approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged
layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere
using the incipient merged layer approximation .
  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,
and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled
sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds
number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above
the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer
regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .
as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged
regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static
and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .
  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with
decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,
the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy
behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they
are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the
stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .
  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the
same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase
found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated
boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction
theory .
  a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental
data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and
the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations .
qualitative agreement is indicated .

similitude of hypersonic real-gas flows over slender
bodies with blunted noses .
  on the basis of the hypersonic small-perturbation theory, the
laws of similitude for hypersonic inviscid flow fields over thin or
slender bodies are examined, and the restrictions to ideal gases
with constant specific heats and to bodies with pointed noses are
removed .  only steady plane or axisymmetric flows are
considered .
  inspection of the governing system of equations shows that a
similitude law exists for flow fields, under local thermal
equilibrium, having the same free-stream atmosphere .  for flows of
ideal gas with constant specific heats, the requirement of the same
free-stream atmosphere--i.e., the same composition, pressure, and
density--can be replaced by the requirement of the same ratio of
specific heats .
  for flows over blunted wedges or cones, special laws of
similitude can be obtained .
  application of the similarity rules is examined for the case of
hypersonic flows of an ideal gas with over flat plates
with blunt leading edges, and for the case of equilibrium air
flows over wedges .  the possibility of simulating nonequilibrium
flows over slender or thin bodies is also pointed out .

influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer
at hypersonic speeds .
in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at
hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on
the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of
steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp
leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal
shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large
region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave
very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly
curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the
boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,
and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave
larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,
and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the
framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave
influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt
leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against
the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental
data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this
parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the
leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical
and experimental study .

are described in references 1 and 2 .  in the laminar boundary
layer the recovery factors and heat-transfer coefficients measured
with zero injection agreed within per cent with theory .
transition reynolds numbers observed on the porous cone with
zero injection were half as large as observed on a smooth,
impermeable model of identical geometry in the same channel, but
injection of large amounts of air or helium did not cause
transition to move forward from its zero-injection position on the
porous cone .  distributed roughness of this type apparently does
not disturb impermeable wall theory, but it masks whatever
effective roughness may be caused by discrete pore injection .

the analytical design of an axially symmetric laval
nozzle for a parallel and uniform jet .
  the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived by
integration of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flow .
since it is not possible to integrate these equations
mathematically in an exact form, it was necessary to find a way to
approximate the calculations .  the approximation offers itself by
considering and comparing the conditions of the flow in a cone with
those in a nozzle, as a linearization of the characteristic equations .
  the first part of the report deals with equations for the
transition curve by which the conical source flow is converted into a
parallel stream of uniform velocity .  the equations are derived
by integration along a mach line of the flow in the region where
the conversion takes place .  a factor f is introduced expressing a
relation between the direction and the velocity of the flow along
a certain mach line .  f remains undetermined and is not involved
in the final equations .
  in the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flow
section is converted into a plane circular section of the throat .
the nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arc
of a circle connected with the transition curve by a straight line .
the gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line are
calculated in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculations
considerably .

effect of diffusion fields on the laminar boundary
layer .
  a theory is developed which describes the effect of a general
diffusion field on the dynamic and thermal characteristics of a
laminar boundary layer on a flat plate in steady compressible
flow .  fluid properties are considered as functions of
temperature and local concentration of the foreign gas .  the diffusion
field is described by a differential equation that relates
convective and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currents
arising from gradients of concentration and temperature .  by
means of the usual transformations the system is reduced to a set
of ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformed
into a set of integral equations .  the latter is amenable to
solution by the method of successive approximations .
  the theory and results have bearing on the problem of control
and reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds .
the special feature of this approach lies in the utilization of
diffusion fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effects
of viscous dissipation .  although the theory is adapted to a
fuller investigation of this problem, the numerical examples
considered involve mainly diffusion fields of helium, with which
good results have been achieved at mach numbers 8 and 12 .
whereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat was
practically eliminated, a reversal in the direction of heat flow has
been effected at the lower mach number .

some experimental techniques in mass transfer cooling .
  author introduces his survey by a brief review of the history of
investigations dealing with boundary layers on impermeable solid
surfaces, and notes that no true theory exists for turbulent
boundary layers, the success of studies in this area having been due to
the introduction of artificial, if ingenious, assumptions which
permitted empirical correlations fd data .  the terminology introduced
by the author for distinguishing the different situations involving
mass transfer from the wall to the stream may give rise to some
objections .  for instance, /film cooling/ need not refer only to
the injection of a liquid, since applications involving gas film
cooling exist .  also, his restriction of the term /transpiration
cooling/ to refer to the injection through a porous surface of a gas
only of the same composition as the exterior stream does not enjoy
universal usage .  the influence of mass transfer on heat transfer
through laminar boundary layers and on the transition from laminar
to turbulent flow is described, with consideration given to the
question of the net effect of the stabilizing influence of surface
cooling and the destabilizing influence of injection .
  reviewer suggests that author's inaccurate statement to the
effect that /thus far the higher energy conditions do not threaten
to involve turbulent injection, so turbulent boundary-layer research
enjoys a fairly academic serenity broken only by its own
frustrations/ be excused on grounds of poetic license, although it
ignores the efforts being devoted to the pressing practical problems
of erosive burning of solid propellants (possibly the most common
example of a complete /aerothermochemical/ problem involving
distributed surface heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction
in a flow system) and of effusion cooling of rocket nozzles, both
of which involve turbulent boundary-layer conditions .  author
emphasizes the tedious experimental problems involved in research
on boundary layers with blowing, and notes the desirability of
velocity distribution measurements, especially in turbulent injection
layers .  the observation that no good data on concentration
profiles in the case of the diffusion boundary layer have been
published may be an overstatement, since author's bibliography
overlooks the work of j. berger (/contribution a l'etude de l'injection
parietale,/ doctor's thesis, university of paris, memorial des
poudres 38 (annex), p. 1,. paris, imprimerie nationale, 1956) .

  direct measurements of supersonic local skin friction, using the
floating-element technique, are presented for mach numbers from
bulent flow and transition are emphasized, although some
measurements in the laminar regime are included .  the observed effect
of compressibility is to reduce the magnitude of turbulent skin
friction by a factor of two at a mach number of 4.5 and a
reynolds number of about 10 .
  the boundary-layer momentum-integral equation for constant
pressure is verified within a few per cent by two experimental
methods .  typical static pressure measurements are presented to
show that transition can be detected by observing disturbances
in pressure associated with changes in displacement thickness
of the boundary layer .
  it is found that the turbulent boundary layer cannot be defined
experimentally for values of less than about 2,000, where
is the momentum thickness .  for larger values of there is a
unique relationship between local friction coefficient and
momentum-thickness reynolds number at a fixed mach number .  the

  a simple expression is derived for the normal injection velocity
distribution theoretically required to maintain a given uniform
temperature along a porous surface in the laminar
boundary-layer region of a compressible flow with a given velocity
distribution outside of the boundary layer .  this expression is valid for
any given free-stream mach number but is based on a prandtl
number of unity and on the assumption that the viscosity
coefficient varies linearly with the temperature .  by using the
dorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluid
properties even in the case of zero mach number is taken into
account .  this study is of particular practical interest in
connection with the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfaces
in high speed flow .  the method of analysis consists of applying
the karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum and
energy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heat
balance equation, involving the coolant temperature .  a
closed-form approximate solution of the equations is then derived .
numerical examples for flow in the immediate vicinity of a

the effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnation
point .
an effective means of protecting the surface of a hypersonic re-entry
vehicle is to inject small quantities of a lightweight gas into the
boundary layer through a porous wall .  this process, which is known
as mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two ways .  first
of all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir through
the wall to the surface, a considerable quantity of heat is absorbed as
its temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wall
surface temperature .  characteristically, lightweight gases have
relatively high specific heats .
secondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusion
normal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundary
layer in such a manner as to reduce the temperature gradient at the
wall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wall .  this is
sometimes referred to as the blowing effect .

optimum nose shapes for missiles in the super-aerodynamic

  the mechanics of the kinetic theory of gases is employed to
describe the drag force on the nose of a missile moving in the
super-aerodynamic region of the atmosphere .  three separate cases are
considered--ideal specular reflection, specular-type reflection
from a slightly rough surface, and surface absorption followed by
random emission of the striking molecules .  the calculus of
variations is employed to obtain the differential equation of the nose
shape which minimizes the drag force for each of the three cases .
the resulting differential equations are then solved by a numerical
procedure .  the drag coefficients for the optimum nose shapes are
likewise determined and these are compared with the drag
coefficients given by other nose shapes .  it is further shown that
the drag coefficients arising when specular-type reflections occur
are significantly dependent on the nose shape .  when surface
absorption followed by random emission occurs, the drag
coefficient is not strongly dependent on either the missile nose shape
or the fineness ratio of the nose .

separation where the flow downstream of the separation region is free to
adjust to any direction that may result from the shock-boundary-layer
interaction process .  a detailed model of the free shock-separated
turbulent boundary layer is postulated, and the pressure rise following
from this model is estimated and compared with experiments .  the

note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawed
cone .
  it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived for
slender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, is
applicable for mach numbers as low as 3 .  this note makes use of
a series development to infer the hypersonic similarity law for
unyawed cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations and
associated boundary conditions .  a simple approximate formula
for the function of the similarity law is obtained,
and the drag function computed with this formula is compared
with kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, with
von karman's linearized formula .

lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flow .
the importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles of
attack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part of
the total lift of a winged missile . in this paper an attempt has been
made to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method
and, together with a correlation of existing experimental data, to
indicate the probable variation of body lift over a wide range of mach
numbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonic . the method of
analysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employed
herein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximation . it is an
improvement on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since it
considers the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of the
air particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces .

an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter
in real fluids .
it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve
slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow
theory, even at small angles of attack .  as the stall angle is
approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus
deviates even more from the theoretical value .  pinkerton
employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure
distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment
is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory .
this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski
condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with
the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the
flow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving a
fictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory is
valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer
thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the
displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate
source distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated,
of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is
applied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, by
generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston
and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge
shall have the same value when determined from the
potential-flow values above and below the airfoil .  this procedure gives
qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady
flow .

.W
a method for analysing the insulating properties of
the laminar compressible boundary layer .
  in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows
it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for
example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip,
and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer
to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling
on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this
upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with
optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes,
wings, and bodies of high-speed aircraft and missiles .
  in this paper a method for investigating the insulating
properties of a laminar compressible boundary layer on a two-
dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical
situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the
heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is
completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the
temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction
from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer
established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream
surface .
  the karman integral method extended to both the momentum
and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer
has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection
ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions
and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum,
and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous
by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity
and stagnation enthalpy profiles .  thus the velocity and
stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree
polynomials .  the resulting two integral-differential equations
are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along
the wall .  these two functions are related to the boundary-layer
thickness and to the wall temperature .  initial conditions
corresponding to a given initial wall temperature and an initial
boundary-layer thickness are prescribed .  exact closed-form solutions
for the case of zero axial pressure gradient are obtained .  for
flows with significant pressure gradients, numerical solutions
are required in general .  several numerical examples of practical
interest are presented .

treated in a new manner which is useful for various

suggested by the exact solutions is developed and shown to lead

paper discusses some problems in the application of this
form of control to homing missiles .
  in comparison with the alternative cartesian
configuration, this method presents some special design
problems .  in the former case, it is often possible to
resolve the motion into two planes and consider the
pitch and yaw control systems as independent
two-dimensional problems .  this simplification is not
possible in the case of polar control and it is usually
necessary to consider the whole three-dimensional
system .  the equations of motion which result are, in
general, not susceptible to analysis .  because of this,
the design of control systems requires extensive use of
simulators .

an approximate solution of the supersonic blunt body
problem for prescribed arbitrary axisymmetric shapes .
  the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out to
the first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodies
in supersonic or hypersonic flight .  this method is direct, in
that it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape for
a prescribed body .  results obtained by numerical integration
for several body shapes at several mach numbers are compared
to experimental results with good agreement .  it is also shown
that the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodies
with attached shock .  in the stagnation region, simple
relationships are found from the equations of the first approximation
which connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,
shock-detachment distance, and body curvature .  these
relations are also correlated with experiment for a variety of shapes
as a function of mach number .  the correlations permit a rapid
estimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important for
heat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shock
stand-off distance .  a method for a higher approximation is
described, for which, in contrast to the higher approximations of
belotserkovskii, a large number of simultaneous total differential
equations with unknown parameters does not occur .  one form
of this method has been studied numerically .  results are given
which, though only partially successful, indicate the amount of
improvement to be expected from a higher approximation .

theoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylinder
combination .
in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for
the determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies
and afterbodies at high mach numbers .  for quasi-spherical bodies
it has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination
with a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two
laws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal .
no simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies .
as for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave
analogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular
afterbody profiles .
the purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate
estimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field about
a hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow .  it was felt that since
experimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce
and very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interest .  the
basis of comparison is the flow field as it results from a numerical
integration of the exact equations governing the motion of the ideal
fluid .

note on tip-bluntness effects in the supersonic and

in a recent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data on
flows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted
tips .  since the demarcation between the supersonic and
hypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows
to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--
especially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the
entire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's
results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15
half-angle cones at m = 2.45 .  following the observation by charters
and stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones
imply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the
convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone
with truncated tip .  they employ the mach-zehnder
interferometer and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools .

the generalized expansion method and its application
to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds .
  it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be
generalized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of
which is flow about airfoils .  this generalized method predicts
the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and
resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on
the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with
which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the
divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of
secondary importance compared to those associated with the
curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface .  it is
shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as
well as two-dimensional hypersonic flows .  when they are met,
surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn,
may be related to the geometry of the surface .
  the validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for
three-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing
predictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and
bow shock waves of bodies of revolution .  the bodies treated
are two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5 .  tests were
conducted at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up
to 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the
ames aeronautical laboratory .  at the lower angles of attack,
theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of
mach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic
similarity parameter--exceeds 1 .  at the larger angles of attack, theory
tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides
of the bodies .
  as a final point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of
inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic
boundary-layer flows .  the question is answered in the
affirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial
check of this conclusion .

steady flow in the laminar boundary layer of a gas .
if the boundary-layer equations for a gas are
transformed by mises's transformation, as
was done by karman   tsion for the flow
along a flat plate of a gas with unit prandtl
number, the computation of solutions is
simplified, and use may be made of previously
computed solutions for an incompressible fluid .
for any value of the prandtl number, and
any variation of the viscosity with the temperature
t, after the method has been applied
to flow along a flat plate (a problem otherwise treated
by crocco), the flow near the forward
stagnation point of a cylinder is calculated with
dissipation neglected, both with the effect of
gravity on the flow neglected and with this effect
retained for vertical flow past a horizontal
cylinder .  the approximations involved by the neglect
of gravity are considered generally,
and the cross-drift is calculated when a horizontal
stream flows past a vertical surface .
when, and the boundary is heat-insulated,
it is shown that the boundary-layer
equations for a gas may be made identical, whatever be
the main stream, with the
boundary-layer equations for an incompressible fluid with a certain,
determinable, main stream .  the
method is also applied to free convection at a flat plate
variation with altitude of the state of the surrounding
fluid neglected) and to laminar flow in
plane wakes, but for plane jets the conditions,
previously imposed by howarth,
are also imposed here in order to obtain simple solutions .

the axisymmetric boundary layer on a long thin cylinder .
the laminar boundary layer in axial flow about
a long thin cylinder is investigated by two
methods .  one (2) is a pohlhausen method,
based on a velocity profile chosen to represent
conditions near the surface as accurately as
possible .  the other (3) is an asymptotic series
solution, valid far enough downstream from
the nose for the boundary-layer thickness to
have become large compared with the cylinder
radius .  another series solution (due to seban,
bond and kelly) is known, valid near enough
to the nose for the boundary layer to be thin
compared with the cylinder radius .  the
pohlhausen solution shows good agreement with
both series, near and far from the nose, and
enables an interpolation to be made (4) between
them in the extensive range of distances from
the nose for which neither is applicable .  the
final recommended curves, for the variation
along the cylinder of skin friction,
boundary-layer displacement area and momentum defect
area, are displayed in graphical and tabular
form (figure 1 and table 1) and are expected to
be correct to within about 2 .
  the velocity near the wall is closely proportional
to the logarithm of the distance from the
axis,. this is the profile used in the pohlhausen
method .  the analogy with the distribution
of mean velocity in turbulent flow over a flat

the pressure gradient induced by shear flow past a

  article is a continuation of an earlier note on papers by li
on a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow .  li had deduced
from the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused an
induced pressure gradient in the flow .  later papers by li and
murray (amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressure
gradient theory .  the author notes, however, that the mathematics used
by li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus not
resolved .  the present note sets up simple models of complete flows
examinable by elementary means .  author holds that analyses
demonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced in
the boundary layer on a flat plate in a limited region of shear flow .
he notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shear
remains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not of
great practical importance .

some panel-flutter studies using piston theory .
  the use of piston theory was recently advocated for
supersonic aeroelastic analyses, including the problem of panel flutter,
and this has stimulated the investigation reported here .
  linear piston theory is mainly considered, but some effects of
introducing higher order terms are discussed .
  flutter of rectangular simply supported panels and of
elliptically shaped clamped-edge panels is considered, and some
justification is provided for the use of /static/ aerodynamic forces
and the neglect of aerodynamic damping .  hence, it is concluded
that ackeret loading gives more exact results than piston theory .
  solution of the flutter equations is made by applying galerkin's
method to a rayleigh-type analysis using assumed modes of
deformation .

forces yields flutter boundaries with satisfactory accuracy for
mach numbers greater than about 2 .  two panel flutter analyses
are performed using this static approximation in conjunction with
thin-plate theory--one employs aerodynamic strip theory, the
other aerodynamic surface theory .  the influence of mach
number, dynamic pressure, panel aspect ratio, and midplane
stress on the panel thickness required to prevent flutter is
determined for extensive ranges of these parameters .

new methods in heat flow analysis with application
to flight structures .
  new methods are presented for the analysis of transient heat
flow in complex structures, leading to drastic simplifications in
the calculation and the possibility of including nonlinear and
surface effects .  these methods are in part a direct application of
some general variational principles developed earlier for linear
thermodynamics .  they are further developed in the
particular case of purely thermal problems to include surface and
boundary-layer heat transfer, nonlinear systems with
temperature-dependent parameters, and radiation .  the concepts of
thermal potential, dissipation function, and generalized thermal
force are introduced, leading to ordinary differential equations
of the lagrangian type for the thermal flow field .  because of the
particular nature of heat flow phenomena, compared with
dynamics, suitable procedures must be developed in order to formulate
each problem in the simplest way .  this is done by treating a
number of examples .  the concepts of penetration depth and
transit time are introduced and discussed in connection with
one-dimensional flow .  application of the general method to the
heating of a slab, with temperature-dependent heat capacity,
shows a substantial difference between the heating and cooling
processes .  an example of heat flow analysis of a supersonic wing
structure by the present method is also given and requires only
extremely simple calculations .  the results are found to be in
good agreement with those obtained by the classical and much

stress due to fluid injection into the boundary layer is found under
the hypothesis that the effect of injection is restricted to the
sublayer region .  experimental measurements of the velocity
profiles with fluid injection substantiate this hypothesis .  the
theoretical decrease in wall shear stress is in good agreement
with experiment,. the solution is particularly simple and for small

inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled non-equilibrium
processes .
  analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate
processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy
levels .  exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the
inverse method for inviscid airflow over a near-spherical nose
under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails
through the nose region .  typical conditions considered include
nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and
velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec .
  the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling
among the reactions considered .  these included
dissociation-recombination, bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactions .
the exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions
to be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n,
as they are in the case of a plane shock wave .  an important
difference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow,
however, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the
former .  this expansion reduces post-shock reaction rates .  as a
consequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom
concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below
those for infinite-rate equilibrium .  the reduction below the
equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for
nitrogen dissociation at higher velocities .
  in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated
by two-body collision processes .  the inviscid nose flow,
including coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to
binary scaling for a given velocity .  the binary scaling is
demonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the
exact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of
ambient density and nose radius .  this similitude, which can
also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the
shock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing
where it is applicable .
  the afterbody inviscid-flow problem is briefly discussed in the
light of the results for the nose flow .

two dimensional transonic flow past airfoils .
  this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for
transonic flows over symmetric airfoils .  the aspect of the problem
emphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressible
flow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the
mapping of the incompressible flow .  in the case of the symmetric
joukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,
but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate .  as
a result, the problem requires simplification .  instead of the exact
incompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which
is derived from a combination of source and sink .  this flow differs
only slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small .  by the
same method, the flow with circulation is also considered .
  after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this
fashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible
flow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any
essential difficulty .

on the behaviour of boundary layers at supersonic speeds .
this paper considers the implications of recent advances in knowledge of
 the behaviour of boundary layers in supersonic flow . only the simplest
 case is considered-dashthat of the two-dimensional boundary layer on a
flat plate, with nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperature
gradients .
it is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with success
in approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers is
closely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocity .
furthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundary
layers may be the same . a nonrigorous approach is made to the problems
of self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that their
effects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at mach
numbers greater than 5 and they increase as the surface temperature
builds up towards zero heat-transfer conditions . the effects with
turbulent boundary layers may not be so severe .
finally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of the
drag and aerodynamic heating problems up to m 10, and one result is
that, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers between
surface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and those
which may be thought necessary for preserving a laminar boundary layer,
then it may be better to choose the former .

methods of boundary-layer control for postponing and alleviating
buffeting and other effects of shock-induced separation .
the use of boundary-layer control to increase the separation-free
margins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point of
high-speed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impair
 the cruising performance or the landing and take-off characteristics .
the factors that influence the choice of method and details of its
application are discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintain
effectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of
separation positions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with
changing flight conditions .
research at the national physical laboratory that has embraced
high-velocity blowing, vane and air-jet vortex generators, and, in a
preliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly described . the
relative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some results
achieved in their application are given .
for vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex paths
determined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and their
images . thus, systems of counter-rotating vortices always leave the
surface in pairs and lose their effectiveness . co-rotating systems are
therefore preferred for many applications . blowing, which in
wind-tunnel tests gives results as good as or better than vortex generators
and does not have the disadvantage of a drag penalty at cruise, has not
yet been assessed in flight . air-jet vortex generators, which would
also avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significant
effects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities .

on the stability of two dimensional parallel flows .
  this is the last part of the author's theory of the stability
of plane laminar motion .  (for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same
quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .)
the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in
detail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion
of stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an
number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same
wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds
number is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of
viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the
general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical
significance is carefully discussed .
  the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called
neutral curve for the two characteristic types of
velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and
the symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the
neutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between
profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two
branches of the neutral curve approach and for
profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile
without a flex .  the most important results are as follows .
for sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always
exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a
similar result was obtained by synge from energy
considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the
motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the
asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further
that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond
which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence
the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .
  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate
expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his
general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these
approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius
flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds
numbers are based on the width of the channel and the
displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method
for computing the complete instability curve is presented
and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked
out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been
given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more
exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far
as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .
the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for
poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the
minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the
agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion
mentioned above is thus very good .
  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous
effects and of future developments concludes the paper .

the design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web
plates subjected to shear .
  the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates
subjected to shear becomes very important when
the web plates are designed
to operate at loads close to their buckling loads .
this paper presents details
of an extensive series of tests conducted on
stiffened web plates subjected to
shear .  from the analysis of the results obtained
from these tests, new empirical
relationships between the flexural rigidity and
spacing of the intermediate
stiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffened
web plate have been obtained .
  one interesting and important feature of
these new relationships is that
they define more clearly than hitherto the difference
in the behaviour of
single-and double-sided stiffeners .

an experimental study of the flow field about swept and delta wings
with sharp leading edges .
a series of experiments was performed to define the flow field on the
upper surface of high aspect ratio swept wings and narrow delta wings at
 high angles of attack .
it was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flow
is conical . the edge of the vortex sheet which originates at the
leading edge is a straight line whose position relative to the leading edge
depends only on incidence . on swept wings, the vortex edge turns
down-stream as soon as the vortex sheet covers the front half of the wing
chord, and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turning
point is uniform and parallel to the leading edge of the wing . on
narrow delta wings, the conical symmetry persists almost to the trailing
edge .

analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies of
revolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonic
speeds .
  a systematic study of induced pressures on a series
of bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntness
has been made by using the method of characteristics
for a perfect gas .  the fluid mediums investigated
were air and helium and the mach number range
was from 5 to 40 .  a study of representative shock
shapes was also made .  flow parameters obtained
from the blast-wave analogy gave good correlations of
induced pressures and shock shapes .  the
induced-pressure correlations yielded empirical equations for
air and helium which cover the complete range of
nose bluntness considered .  (nose fineness ratios
varied from 0.4 to 4.)  available experimental
results were in good agreement with the characteristics
solutions .  properties connected with the concept of
hypersonic similitude enabled correlations of the
calculations to be made with respect to nose shape,
mach number, and ratio of specific heats .

an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed
cones at a mach number of 5. 8.
  shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured
on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a
range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles
of yaw from 0 to 8 .  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8,
and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in
determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution .
  the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed
and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified
newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the
normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow
shock .  cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in
determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and
over the conical afterbody .  on the 40 spherical nosed cone models
the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in
the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure
returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value .  for models with smaller
cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on
the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was
approached more gradually .  the shape of the pressure distributions
as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the
radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range
of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 .
  integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero
yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian
approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose
radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll
theory for sharp cones .

preliminary analysis of axial flow compressors having
supersonic velocity at the entrance of the stator .
  a supersonic compressor design having supersonic velocity at the
entrance of the stator is analyzed on the assumption of two-dimensional
flow .  the rotor and stator losses assumed in the analysis are based on
the results of preliminary supersonic cascade tests .  the results of
the analysis show that compression ratios per stage of 6 to 10 can be
obtained with adiabatic efficiency between 70 and 80 percent .
  consideration is also given in the analysis to the starting,
stability, and range of efficient performance of this type of
compressor .  the desirability of employing variable-geometry stators
and adjustable inlet guide vanes is indicated .  although either
supersonic or subsonic axial component of velocity at the stator
entrance can be used, the cascade test results suggest that higher
pressure recovery can be obtained if the axial component is supersonic .

the quasi-cylinder of specified thickness and shell

  the methods of the operational
calculus are used to obtain a linear
approximation to the shape of the mean camber
surface of a quasi-cylinder in a
supersonic flow in terms of its shell thickness
and loading distributions .  the
analysis deals with a generalised quasi-cylinder ,.
that is one which, although lying
close to a mean cylinder, need not possess
axial symmetry .  the quasi-cylinder
is also permitted to be within the small
disturbance field of other separate
components, e.g. a centre-body .  because
the linearised theory is inadmissable
for internal duct flows close to and beyond
the first reflected characteristic cone,
the present solution is likewise invalid close
to and beyond the position where
this characteristic meets the mean cylinder .
the work given here enables the
camber shapes of /ring-wings/, which have
been used theoretically to reduce or
even nullify the wave-drag of a central slender-body,
to be found .  an example
illustrates the general method .

  five free-flight models were flown to measure the zero-lift drag and
body base pressure on a standard wind tunnel interference model over a

  roughness bands on the wings and body of the model are shown to
produce a small but definite increase in the zero-lift drag at all mach

  the measured drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measurements
made in various transonic tunnels with differences that could plausibly
be explained as the effects of tunnel interference .
  the effect of a simulated wind tunnel support sting is shown to
increase the base pressure .  the discrepancy between models with and
without a sting is greatest at subsonic speeds and progressively
decreases with increasing mach number until at m = 1.4 the sting has no

theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment due

  a method of analysis based on slender-wing theory is developed
to investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wings

conformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics which
transform the region outside a circle and the region outside
an arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at the
origin .  the method of analysis may be utilized to solve other
slender cruciform wing-body problems involving arbitrarily
assigned boundary conditions .
  in the present report, the application of the method has
shown ..
differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of the
cruciform wing-body combinations are practically independent
of the body-diameter-maximum-span ratio up to a value of this
ratio of 0.3 .
arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that for a
corresponding planar wing-body combination .
dence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciform
wing-body arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than that
for a corresponding planar wing-body combination .
unit surface deflection) of the cruciform wing-body arrangement
having four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent of
the corresponding planar wing-body combination .

application of two dimensional vortex theory to the
prediction of flow fields behind wings of wing-body
combinations at subsonic and supersonic speeds .
  a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for
predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing
and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender
configurations at subsonic speeds .  the wing trailing-vortex wake is
represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the
spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the
exposed wing panels .  the afterbody is represented by corresponding
image vortices within the body .  two-dimensional line-vortex theory is
then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the
resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a
numerical stepwise integration procedure .  the method was applied to the
calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of
downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and
cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of
such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and
incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on
the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied .
the relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image
vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total
downwash was assessed at a possible tail location .
  it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted
the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations
with reasonable facility and accuracy .  a calculated sample wake shape
agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample
results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact
crossflow-plane solution .  an empirical formula was derived to estimate
the number  of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory
computation of downwash at tail locations .  it was found that the shape
of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind
a wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing
edge .  for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations
considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is
largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing
vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by
the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .

contributions of the wing panels to the forces and

  a wind-tunnel investigation was
conducted at a mach number of 1.96
and at reynolds numbers (based on the
mean aerodynamic chord of the
exposed wing) of 0.36 and 1.03 million
to determine the normal forces,
pitching moments, and rolling moments
contributed by each wing panel of
a cruciform-wing and body combination
over a wide range of combined
angles of pitch and roll .  the wings
were triangular of aspect ratio 2,
and the body was an ogive-cylinder
combination .  the effects of forebody
length and roughness and of the
presence of the adjacent panels on these
panel contributions were determined .
  the results of the investigation
show that large changes in the panel
forces and moments can occur as the
result of combined angles .  a general
theoretical method based on slender-body
and strip theories was found to
yield results in good agreement with the
wind-tunnel measurements .  these
comparisons indicate that the changes in
the panel characteristics due to
combined angles are caused primarily by
a cross coupling between the
side-wash velocities due to angle of attack
and sideslip and by the presence
of forebody vortices due to crossflow
separation .  it was found that an
increase in forebody length increases
the effect of the forebody vortices
because of the dependence of the strength
of these vortices on the forebody
length .

  an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transfer
distributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shape
and on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed for
laminar boundary layers .  the method involves the quadrature of a
function of the pressure distribution (assumed given) and satisfies
the integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity,
wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station are
replaced by corresponding profiles from a family of similar solutions .
  the method is compared with other local similarity methods and
with experimental heat-transfer data on a circular cylinder and on a
body of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradients .  good
agreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that the
present integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, gives
generally better agreement with the data than certain other local
similarity methods .
  numerical examples are presented showing that the effect of sweep
and gas properties on heat-transfer distribution is small .

a factor affecting transonic leading edge flow separation .
  a change in flow pattern that was observed as the free-stream mach
number was increased in the vicinity of 0.8 was described in naca
technical note 1211 by lindsey, daley, and humphreys .  the flow on the
upper surface behind the leading edge of an airfoil at an angle of
attack changed abruptly from detached flow with an extensive region of
separation to attached supersonic flow terminated by a shock wave .  in
the present paper, the consequences of shock-wave--boundary-layer
interaction are proposed as a factor that may be important in determining the
conditions under which the change in flow pattern occurs .  when the
mach number is high enough, the attached-flow pattern exists because
then the shock wave is far enough behind the leading edge to keep the
influence of the high pressure behind the shock wave from extending
through the boundary layer to the immediate vicinity of the leading edge
and affecting the flow there .  some experimental evidence in support of

compilation of information on the transonic attachment

  schlieren photographs have been compiled of the two-dimensional flow
at transonic speeds past 37 airfoils having variously shaped profiles,
some of which are related and vary in thickness and camber .  the data
for these airfoils were analyzed to provide basic information on the
flow changes involved and to determine factors affecting transonic-flow
attachment, which is a transition from separated to unseparated flow at
the leading edges of two-dimensional airfoils at fixed angles of attack
as the subsonic mach number is increased .

evaluation of high angle-of-attack aerodynamic derivative
data and stall-flutter prediction techniques .
  the problem of stall flutter is approached in two ways .  first,
using the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions on
wings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stall
range have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible with
available published data, with the purpose of providing empirical
information where no aerodynamic theory exists .  the major effects of
reynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamic
reactions have been reaffirmed .  no instances of negative damping were
observed in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative damping
occurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by other
experimenters .  data on the time-average values in the stall range of
both lift and moment are presented for the first time .
  second, the results of numerous experimental observations of stall
flutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at its
prediction have been examined, compared, and extended .  the sharp drop in
critical speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscillation
usually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutter
is apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changes
in moment due to pitch .  fairly good stall-flutter predictions have
been reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamic
reaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape,
reynolds number range, and reduced-frequency range .  a semiempirical
method of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoil
shape, reduced frequency, initial angle of attack, and amplitude of
oscillation has been presented .

some effects of variations in several parameters including
fluid density on the flutter speed of light uniform
cantilever wings .
  an experimental investigation has been made of some effects of
variations in several parameters, including fluid density, on the
flutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wings .  the
assortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axis
and center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and 4 .
the relative-density parameter (where k is representative of the
ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of values
from 1.2 to nearly 14 .  special emphasis has been placed on the lower
values .
  the experimental investigation has been supplemented by an
analytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for
incompressible flow .  in a few instances corrections for the effects of
finite span have been made .  in general, the theoretical results
followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of
the relative-density parameter .  for these low values
the analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutter
not found experimentally .  at higher values of the flutter-speed
coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and
to be nearly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the air
density .

pressures were simultaneously measured in the variable-density tunnel
at 54 orifices distributed over the midspan section of a 5 by 30 inch
rectangular model of the n.a.c.a. 4412 airfoil at 17 angles of attack
ranging from -dash 20degree to 30degree at a reynolds number of
approximately 3,000,000 . accurate data were thus obtained for studying the
deviations of the results of potential-flow theory from measured results
technique are presented .
it is shown that theoretical calculations made either at the effective
angle of attack or at a given actual lift do not accurately describe the
 observed pressure distribution over an airfoil section . there is
therefore developed a modified theoretical calculation that agrees
reasonably well with the measured results of the tests of the n.a.c.a. 4412
 section and that consists of making the calculations and evaluating the
 circulation by means of the experimentally obtained lift at the
effective angle of attack,. i.e., the angle that the chord of the model makes
 with the direction of the flow in the region of the section under
consideration . in the course of the computations the shape parameter
is modified, thus leading to a modified or an effective profile shape
that differs slightly from the specified shape .

induction drag on a large negatively charged satellite
moving in a magnetic-field-free ionosphere .
  an induction drag, experienced by a
charged satellite during its traversal of the
ionosphere, has been theoretically postulated by
several authors .  previous 'exact' treatments
of the problem are inapplicable to large systems, and
the semiempirical approach of jastrow
and pearse may yield somewhat questionable results .
the present description initially
considers the satellite as a completely permeable spherical
shell of charge, thus avoiding the
difficult boundary conditions introduced by the 'exact'
linearized treatment .  the effects of
permeability are then shown to be approximately removable
by means of an iterative process .  a
final result, apparently valid to within an order of
magnitude, is obtained for the drag force
arising solely from electrical effects .  its magnitude
is considerably less than that obtained by
jastrow and pearse .

the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift .
the cornell aeronautical laboratory is conducting a program of
theoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics as
applied to stol and vtol aircraft .  the objective of this program is to
re-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in the
light of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking
aerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed
performance .
one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received
increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of
longitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream .  this
slipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing
characteristics .  in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with
a propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the
replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform
jet, free of all velocity
gradients .  the application of these theories requires that one equate
the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet .  one method
employed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the
average in the propeller slipstream .  these and similar procedures
are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit
assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence
the wing characteristics .

several approximate analyses of the bending of a rectangular
cantilever plate by uniform normal pressure .
  three methods of approximating the deflections and
moments occurring in a rectangular cantilever plate
subjected to uniform normal pressure over its entire surface
are presented in this paper .  the first is the application of
the well-known finite-difference procedure .  the second
and third are collocation methods, one based upon
polynomial solutions of the lagrange equation, the other
employing /mixed/ hyperbolic-trigonometric terms
satisfying this equation .  in the last two methods the boundary
conditions are satisfied exactly along the clamped edge and
at a finite number of points along the free edges of the plate .
the results obtained for the particular case of a cantilever
plate with uniform normal load indicate that the use of a
relatively small number of points in the collocation
method yields values of deflections and moments that are
in substantial agreement with those given by the
finite-difference procedure .  it cannot be concluded from these
results that the collocation method using the assumed
functions will give satisfactory results with fewer points
than the finite-difference method for cantilever plates with
loading different from the one investigated .

on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .
  the theory of the laminar boundary layer
offers a means of determining the skin friction
under the assumption of a given velocity
distribution outside the boundary layer .  owing to the
mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions
are possible only when the velocity distribution
is expressed as a simple function of the distance
along the surface .  more complicated velocity
distributions necessitate recourse to the method of
expansion in series or that of step-by-step
calculations, but the labor involved is too great for the
methods to be of practical use .  approximate
method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long
been recommended for general use, gives a
reasonably accurate solution in a region of accelerated
flow, but recently its adequacy in a region of
retarded flow has been questioned .  separation of
flow may actually occur where the solution of
pohlhausen fails to give it .  more recently howarth
solution, which gives fairly reasonable results in
a region of retarded flow .
  howarth's solution essentially consists in
solving the boundary layer equations for the particular
case in which the velocity u outside the boundary
layer decreases linearly with the distance x
measured along the surface, and utilizing the solution
by replacing the actual distribution of u by a
circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides .
therefore, it is assumed that the velocity
distribution at any section depends on the velocity
gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected
by the conditions upstream only in so far as this
affects the momentum thickness 0 .  in other words,
the velocity distribution across the boundary layer
is determined by a parameter .

  an experimental study has been made to investigate some aspects

a series of semispan delta-wing models with slender wedge airfoil
sections and very sharp leading edges .  the models had semiapex angles
ranging from 5 to 31.75 .
  separated regions of vorticity existed along the chords of all
the wings in the series tested .  concentrated vortex cores were found
only on wings of very small semiapex angles .  for wings with medium

intended to lead to a type of flow with leading-edge separation in the
lifting condition .  the pressure distributions and overall
normal-pressure drags resulting from various theoretical methods are compared

in the 3 ft tunnel described, together with the associated optical and
photographic equipment .
  the results of tests to determine the humidity required to produce an

over and behind delta wings are included and some comparisons made with

the resulting fog, and the formation of the vapour screen picture are
all considered in some detail .
  the effects of humidity on the mach number and static pressure in the
working section were investigated and the results are compared with
theoretical estimates at a nominal mach number of 2.0 .  it is shown
that the adverse effects of condensation on the flow at high mach
numbers may be alleviated by the use of liquids with a lower latent heat

thin airfoil theory based on approximate solution of the transonic flow
equation .
the present paper describes a method for the approximate solution of the
 nonlinear equations of transonic small disturbance theory . although
the solutions are nonlinear, the analysis is sufficiently simple that
results are obtained in closed analytic form for a large and significant
 class of nonlifting airfoils . application to two-dimensional flows
with free-stream mach number near 1 leads, for instance, to general
expressions for the determination of the pressure distribution on an
airfoil of specified geometry and for the shape of an airfoil having a
prescribed pressure distribution and gives, furthermore, the correct
variation of pressure with mach number at mach number 1 . for flows that
 are subsonic everywhere, the method yields a pressure-correction
formula that is more accurate than the prandtl-glauert rule and compares
favorably with existing higher approximations . for flows that are
supersonic everywhere, the method yields the equivalent, in transonic
approximation, of simple wave theory . results obtained by application
of these general expressions are shown to correspond closely to existing
 solutions and to experimental data for a wide variety of airfoils .

  a new method is proposed to calculate the velocity and pressure
distributions around a thin symmetrical aerofoil or a slender body of
revolution flying at transonic speed .  it is essentially a refinement
of the linearized transonic flow theory due to oswatitsch and maeder,
such that a correction term is introduced to take account of the
nonlinear character of the transonic flow .  as examples of application,
a symmetrical circular-arc aerofoil and a circular-arc body of
revolution in the sonic flow are dealt with, and the results are found
to be in good agreement with experiments, except for the rear portion in
the latter case .

in this chapter we shall mainly consider problems of steady, two-

there is a steady wave system, we shall find solutions by an indirect
approach .  that is, we shall first study the conditions under which
simple stationary waves may exist in the flow, and then find the flow
boundaries to which they correspond or which may be fitted to
them .  in this procedure the limited upstream influence in a supersonic
field is very helpful, for it allows flows to be analyzed or
constructed step by step, which is a method that is not possible in

laminar mixing of a compressible fluid .
a theoretical investigation of the velocity profiles for laminar
mixing of a high-velocity stream with a region of fluid at rest
has been made assuming that the prandtl number is unity .  a method
which involves only quadratures is presented for calculating the
velocity profile in the mixing layer for an arbitrary value of the
free-stream mach number .
detailed velocity profiles have been calculated for free-stream mach
numbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 .  for each mach number, velocity profiles
are presented for both a linear and a 0.76-power variation of viscosity
with absolute temperature .  the calculations for a linear variation are
much simpler than those for a 0.76-power variation .  it is shown that
by selecting the constant of proportionality in the linear approximation
such that it gives the correct value for the viscosity in the
high-temperature part of the mixing layer, the resulting velocity profiles
are in excellent agreement with those calculated by a 0.76-power
variation .

the influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoil
maximum lift .
  the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximum
lift are defined with experimental data obtained in a simulated
two-dimensional slipstream .  the experimental results show
that when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the
airfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the
slipstream .  in moving the airfoil from above to below the
slipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance corresponding
to the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer
observations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher
angles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled .
  it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the
non-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary
interference, but stems from the influence of the large local
slipstream shear on airfoil characteristics .  the effects of uniform
and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are
discussed, within the framework of existing first-order,
small-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote
stall .  a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer
in a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects
of stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria .  it is
demonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the
uniform-flow criterion applies .  it is concluded on the basis of
the experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon
stems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in the
inviscid theories .  it is hypothesized that it is a second-order
effect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative
of the shear, which was large in the present experiments .

combined aerothermoelastic problem .
  for the general aerothermoelastic model, where the model is

is shown to be very difficult to achieve for a scale ratio other
than unity .  the primary conflict occurs between the
free-stream mach number reynolds number aeroelastic
parameter heat conduction parameter and
thermal expansion parameter .
  means of dealing with this basic conflict are presented .  these
include (1) looking at more specialized situations, such as the
behavior of wing structures and of thin solid plate lifting surfaces,
and panel flutter, where the aerothermoelastic similarity
parameters assume less restrictive forms, (2) the use of /incomplete
aerothermoelastic/ testing in which the pressure and/or heating
rates are estimated in advance and applied artificially to the
model, and (3) the use of /restricted purpose/ models

aerothermoelastic problem .

real-gas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat
transfer .
  the laminar-boundary-layer equations have been integrated
for the case of a flat plate over a wide range of free-stream
enthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies of
the gas at the wall .  the range of free-stream velocities extended
up to 25,000 ft sec at low free-stream enthalpies, corresponding
to local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds .
at low free-stream velocities, the range of free-stream enthalpies
extended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the local
conditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec .
the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at each
point in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected .
the solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried out
on a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction and
heat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations .
  before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and
johnson for computing skin-friction coefficients for the
perfect-gas case is reviewed .  for the real-gas case, the average
temperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h'
method is then used to compute skin-friction coefficients .  these
values are in excellent agreement with the computing-machine
results .  it was found that the recovery factor for the real-gas
case can be approximated by, the best results for the
cases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding to
the enthalpy, h', is used .  using this recovery factor and
reynolds analogy, heat-transfer rates can be computed which,
with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtained
from computing-machine results .

axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodies
of revolution .
  axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodies
of revolution is treated within the category of the perfect gas .
attention is paid especially to the effect of transverse curvature
of the body .  from the transformed equations, the similarity
conditions are deduced, and the parameter characterizing the
effect of transverse curvature is obtained .  several numerical
solutions of similarity equations for hypersonic flows are
presented, and upon the basis of these results, the effect of the
transverse-curvature parameter is discussed .  a method of
applying the local-similarity approximation to obtain the
approximate solution for nonsimilar cases is described, as are
practical applications to incompressible flow past a long cylinder and
to hypersonic flow past a very slender cone .  comparison with
experimental results shows fair agreement with calculations using
the local-similarity approximation in the present range of

theoretical and experimental investigation of thermal
stresses in hypersonic aircraft wing structures .
  a simple and relatively accurate analytic approximation is
developed to determine the temperature and thermal-stress
distribution in aircraft wing structures .  theoretical investigations
show that the results of the existing thermal-stress theories
which neglect the temperature gradient through the skin
thickness may exceed, in the range of higher biot numbers, the true
values by more than 30 percent .
  refined photothermoelastic experiments verify these results
and add another significant conclusion .  they indicate that
thermal stresses in wing structures generated by a variable
heat-transfer coefficient coincide with the theoretical predictions
which are based on a constant heat-transfer coefficient, as long
as the latter represents the arithmetic average over the heating
cycle and the variation is in the order of 10 percent .
however, even much greater variations in the order of 100 percent
produce only relatively small differences .

calculation of potential flow about bodies of revolution
having axes perpendicular to the free-stream direction .
  a general method is described for calculating, with the aid of
an electronic computer, the potential flow about arbitrary bodies
of revolution whose axes are perpendicular to the free-stream
direction .  when combined with the solution for the
axisymmetric flow about these bodies, this method makes it possible to
calculate the pressure distribution on any body of revolution at
angle of attack forward of any separated region of the flow, and
also to calculate the flow at points off the body surface .  after
the basic equations of the method have been derived, its accuracy
is exhibited by comparison with analytic solutions for ellipsoids
of revolution .  calculated pressure distributions are then
compared with experimental data for a variety of bodies .  the
agreement is quite satisfactory in all cases .  the calculated
velocities for other selected bodies are presented to exhibit
certain properties of this type of flow .

a closed-form solution for the oscillations of a vehicle
entering a planetary atmosphere .
  author considers the equation of the yawing motion of a missile,
derived with a series of customary assumptions and with the
distance traveled as the independent variable .  his assumptions
include the linearity of the aerodynamic forces, the constancy of the
aerodynamic coefficients with respect to mach number, the
absence of spin, and the absence of gravity .  if to these assumptions
one could add the common ballistic assumption of a constant air
density, the coefficients of this equation would have been
con-damped sinusoids .  in ballistics any slow variation of these
coefstant, and the solution would have been simply the
exponentially-ficients is usually treated by adding an approximate correction
term to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb
perturbation) .  however, with a body entering the planetary atmosphere the
variation of the air density is apparently of greater essence (this
is a point not stated explicitly in this brief communication), and
the equation is of the type .
the author shows that with a series of further transformations
the equation can be reduced to the form
the solutions of which are confluent
hypergeometric functions .  these functions are defined as series
involving gamma functions, and with a series of further assumptions
can be reduced to laguerre polynomials and bessel functions .
  it is certainly nice to have an exact solution to a problem which
has heretofore been extensively treated by approximations and by
the numerical approach .  this reviewer is puzzled, however, as to
the practical significance of the proposed approach .  an
idealization is of value in that it facilitates our understanding,. and the
numerical approach, in that it allows refinements of the problem,
freeing us from the necessity of idealizing .  but the proposed
solution is certainly more difficult to refine than the original
problem,. and it is certainly not simple (the solution of the original
equation is not the value of z, but the various /reverse/
transformations of z) .  an evaluation of a series in practice must compete
with the numerical approach,. and the equation suggested is of the
zero) .  viewing the problem /afresh/ (in the light of the /
computer revolution/ and without the constraints imposed by the prior
art), it seems at least equally easy to /standardize/ the
solutions of the original equation .

stability of compressible boundary layers induced by
a moving wave .
  the problem of determining the stability of compressible
viscous flows with nonzero surface velocities is formulated and is
shown to be identical to that for conventional boundary layers,
with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbers
required .  specific consideration is given to the wall boundary
layer behind a moving shock wave, and the minimum critical
reynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities .
the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of a
weak wave, which is analogous to the rayleigh problem .
  the minimum critical reynolds number is found to increase
monotonically with shock velocity--i.e., with increasing surface
cooling and stream mach number combined .  for the ratio of
wall to stream velocity of 2.92 with (shock mach number
of 2.18) the flow is found to be infinitely stable to two-dimensional
disturbances .
  experimental transition data do not follow the trends predicted
by the theory .  in fact, the transition reynolds numbers are
orders of magnitude below the computed minimum critical
reynolds numbers .  the lack of correlation between theory and
experiment is attributed to disturbances which are external to
the boundary layer .

machine .  as there is no physical contact between the vehicle

be similar over land and water .  however, over water there is
an additional resistance to motion due to the gravity-wave
system generated by the supporting or /cushion/ pressure acting
on the water surface .  estimates of this component can be made
using the analysis of t. h. havelock .  it is the purpose of this

tunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interaction

hence, the gas exit angle from the nozzles .  evidence has also been
required that, once the rotor incidence has been allowed for, there is
no adverse effect of the rotors on the nozzle flow, even when the rotors
have a large turning angle .
  the present test cascade represented the stationary configuration
of a turbine of 2.5 nozzle mach number and 74 swirl angle, the rotors
being designed to operate at 1.9 relative mach number and to provide a
turning angle of 140 .  in the tests, fully supersonic flow could be
established through the system, but the losses were fairly high and an
increase in loss of about 25 per cent would have caused choking in the

  the quantity of primary interest is
the temperature of the solid at the interface,
since this can be observed experimentally
without much difficulty .  solutions are
obtained for this quantity which cover a
range of practically plausible relaxation times
and 'wall effect' parameters .  it is essential
to include proper temperature jump
boundary conditions for both active and
relaxing (or inert) energy modes .  thus it is
necessary to know accommodation coefficients
for these modes of energy storage .
the temperature jump effects are found to
dominate the (interface) solid's temperature
time history, with relaxation effects playing
a very secondary role .
  the theoretical results are compared
with some experimental observations and
encouraging agreement is found .  as a
result of this agreement it proves possible to
estimate the accommodation coefficient
for the active modes (in this case for the
combination platinum air), the pressure
being about 15 atmospheres .  the pressure
sensitivity of accommodation effects is commented on .

pressure increased with increase of the ratio of jet diameter to base
diameter and, at high jet stagnation pressures, base pressures higher
than free stream static pressure were found .  the base pressure was
independent of free stream reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10 per

wing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effects
on a finned missile .
  wing-tail interference is shown to cause large /magnus/ effects
on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron
setting .  a simple experimental method with water as the
working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling
missile .  the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with
all-movable wings and fixed tail fins .  magnus data are
presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll
rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the
wings .  tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing
deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction,
thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due
to wing-tail interference .
  a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental
data .  a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is
introduced to predict tail-interference factors .  good agreement with
the data is obtained .
  this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical
magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either
that effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins .
wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate
only modifies the basic interference mechanism .

a note on application of transonic linearization to
an airfoil with a round leading edge .
the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a round
leading edge can be expressed, in general, as
where p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0 .  it is well known that
the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of
compressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a round
leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance
assumption .  the linearized transonic flow theory has the same
short-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil
plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g.,
spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of
refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious
because the sonic point is usually located in a flow region near
the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness .

laminar, transitional and turbulent heat transfer to
a cone-cylinder-flare body at mach 8. 0.
  an experimental investigation of the laminar, transitional, and
turbulent heat transfer rates over a conical cylindrical flared
body is presented .  regions of favorable, zero, and adverse
pressure gradient on the body are investigated .  the experimental
results are compared with the theories available in the literature .
  the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare
configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion
smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body
and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .
  the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over
a range of reynolds number from 0.3 x 10 to 1.6 x 10 per inch
based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to
the test with liquid nitrogen .  the stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .
  the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat
transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the
transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder
and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion
of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only

approximate determination of position of the sonic
line for a blunt body in hypersonic flow .
the detached shock in front of a blunt body in hypersonic
flow tends to acquire the shape of the frontal curvature of the
body .  thus the curvature of the shock can be assumed to be the
same as that of the body, at least up to the sonic point (point a,
fig. 1) .  if the equation of curvature of the body is known, the
equation of curvature of the shock is also known .  in this paper,
with this assumption, a method is described to determine the
approximate position of the sonic line (ao'b, fig. 1) .  the
shock-detachment distance is assumed known .
  the method is, of course, general .  this can be applied to
any detached shock provided its equation of curvature is known
corresponding to that of the body .  for simplicity the detached
shock is assumed to be circular in this paper and the procedure is
outlined below with the assumption that the sonic line ao'b is
parabolic .

leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminar
or turbulent boundary layers .
  the transonic flow round a two-dimensional airfoil at
incidence is often determined by the type of flow in the leading-edge
region .  if the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds it
is liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenly .
a review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundary
layers re-emphasizes the importance of fixing transition when
making model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flows
closest to full-scale conditions .
  it is shown that similar airfoils with attached leading-edge
flow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock .

investigation of the steady two-dimensional incompressible
boundary-layer flow over a flat plate, but it has been extensively used in
investigating other fluid flow problems .  the three-point

some effects of injection of foreign gases in a decelerating
laminar boundary layer in supersonic flow .
  the purpose of this research program was to investigate the
effects of a diffusion field on a laminar boundary layer in a
supersonic flow .  specifically, helium, nitrogen, and argon were
uniformly injected into the laminar boundary layer of a
high-speed flow in a tube with the objective of determining the effects
of such injection on the pressure, temperature, and recovery
factor distribution along and downstream of the injection region .
  a continuously operating axially-symmetric wind tunnel has
been designed, constructed, and operated .  this tunnel consists
of an air supply system, a flowmeter, an upstream stagnation
tank, a supersonic nozzle (throat diameter 0.262 and exit
diameter 1.400), a test section of variable length (zero to 81 diameters,
test section diameter of 1.400), a downstream stagnation tank,
an exhaust system, a foreign gas supply system, and all necessary
instrumentation .  the overall performance of this apparatus in
terms of the design specifications was excellent .
  the tunnel was instrumented with 109 thermocouples .  all
temperatures except ambient temperatures were automatically
measured and recorded by means of a self-balancing recording
potentiometer .  there was 29 pressure taps distributed along the
tunnel, 23 along the test section itself .  pressures were measured
by means of an interconnected micromanometer and a vacuum
referenced manometer system with overlapping ranges .
  for all of the results reported herein, the overall test section
was 41 diameters in length,. composed of a porous test section
approximately 7.2 diameters in length (leading edge
approximately 1.8 diameters from the nozzle exit plane) and four nylon
test sections of 8 diameters each .

an aerodynamic analysis for flutter in oseen-type viscous

  oseen's equations for unsteady flow are employed to obtain
a linearized solution based on a discontinuous-wake model .
the analysis is employed to estimate the viscous correction to
unsteady lift and moment at large reynolds number .  if the
asymptotic solution is not too slowly convergent, the correction
is of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynolds number
to the reynolds number .  the theory is preliminary in nature
as it is limited by the accuracy of oseen's equations and is
restricted to small angle of attack .  however, it also shows that
the generalized trailing-edge condition for potential flow is
reasonable and might predict the essential correction in a real

and a considerable fraction of the reflected or deflected charged

method was found to be successful throughout the region of subsonic
flow .  this shroud was designed as part of a low-turbulence wind tunnel
used for investigating the effects of cooling on boundary-layer
transition on a hemisphere .
the design of the shroud contour was carried out in two steps .  first,
an approximate solution for the incompressible, irrotational flow
field was found in the region, and, second, the resulting contour
was corrected for compressibility near the sonic region, assuming

transition in the viscous wakes of blunt bodies at

  transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the hypersonic
wakes of spheres was detected in laboratory measurements of the
radiation from the flow field .  a hypervelocity gun facility was
used to fire models, 0.22-in. in diameter, into a range at velocities
from 10,000 to 17,000 ft sec .  experiments were performed by
changing ..  (a) the material of the projectile ,. (b) the ambient
gas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range .  three
optical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation ..
which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in the
range is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg .
which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 and
ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the
pressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm
hg for argon .
both air and argon, which show the main features of the flow
field .  above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation
from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear
to be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaks .
  the appearance of the streaks in the drum camera and
photo-multiplier data is interpreted as transition from laminar to
turbulent flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidence
shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical,
radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic
effects .  this conclusion is supported by other experiments based
on optical and schlieren techniques .  the transition in the wake
at positions very close to the body is given by a local reynolds
number of 10 for air, and 3 x 10 for argon .  the results indicate
a possible local-mach-number effect .

the conpressibility transformation and the turbulent

  the compressibility transformation first introduced by
dorod-nitzyn has been applied in this paper to the equations of the
turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transfer
and arbitrary prandtl numbers .  assuming the shear
distribution to be invariant under the transformation, the stream
function and the momentum equation take the proper form for
incompressible flow, allowing the use of incompressible velocity
profiles in the transformed coordinates .  application of crocco's
method to the transformed energy equation permits integration
of the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkably
similar to that proposed by eckert .  finally, the reference
condition was chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer from
considerations of the assumptions made regarding the
shear-stress distribution .  with this choice, the reference enthalpy is in
good agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range of
test conditions .  in view of these results, the analysis may be
considered to provide a theoretical basis for the
reference-enthalpy method .

investigations .  in each case, the

a large number of solutions to the laminar

small disturbance flow theory .  some related
features of the interaction between the effects of

hypersonic equivalence principle and the related
similitude for affinely related bodies are set
forth for nonequilibrium flows in either diatomic

of diatomic gases, as opposed to a given gas
such as air, a generalized ambient gas state
scaling condition is obtained, whereby the
ambient density and temperature need not be

blunted cylinders and slabs or sharp-nosed
cones and wedges, including example
nonequilibrium flow field correlations of numerical
solutions available in the literature .  low density
nonequilibrium flows with a negligible shock

biot's variational principle in heat conduction .
  biot's variational principle is applied to a number of different
one-dimensional heat conduction problems .  these problems
show the applicability of the variational principle to problems
involving prescribed heat flux boundary conditions and to those
with temperature-dependent material properties .
  a method is introduced for including boundary conditions
when these are expressed as prescribed heat fluxes .  the idea
behind this is overall energy balance within the body, which is a
constraint condition to be satisfied by the time histories of the
generalized coordinates .
  the variational principle is then applied to the well-known
problem of constant surface heat flux in order to present the
technique and provide a basis for the remaining sections .  the
equivalence of the result obtained in applying the variational
principle for a prescribed surface temperature history to that
obtained for a prescribed heat flux is also pointed out .  radiation
cooling due to fourth power radiation from semi-infinite solids
and finite slabs together with radiation according to newton's
law of cooling is then treated .  finally, the introduction of
temperature-dependent material properties is discussed and the
determination of the temperature distribution in a semi-infinite

the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence

  the effect of air drag on satellite
orbits of small eccentricity e
was studied in part i (tech. note
gw 533), on the assumption that
atmospheric density varies exponentially
with distance r from the earth's
centre, so that the 'density scale height'
h, defined as, is
constant .  in practice h varies with height
in an approximately linear
manner, and in the present note the theory
is developed for an atmosphere
in which h varies linearly with r .  equations
are derived which show how
perigee distance and orbital period vary
with eccentricity, and how
eccentricity varies with time .  expressions
are also obtained for the
life-time and air density at perigee in terms
of the rate of change of orbital
period .  the results are also presented
graphically .
  the results are formulated in two
ways .  the first is to specify the
extra terms to be added to the constant-h
equations of part i .  the second
the best constant value of h for
use with the equations of part i .  for
example, it is found that the
constant-h equations connecting perigee
distance (or orbital period) and
eccentricity can be used unchanged without
loss in accuracy, if h is taken
as the value of the variable h at a height
above the mean perigee height
during the time interval being considered,
where, and
decreases from to 0 as e decreases
from 0.02 to 0 .  similarly the
constant-h equations for air density at
perigee can still be used if h is
evaluated at a height above perigee,
where, and
decreases to zero as e decreases from
constant-h equations can still be used
if h is evaluated at the scale height
below the initial height .  variation of
h with altitude has a small effect
on the lifetime - about 3 - and on the
e-versus-time curve .

laminar heat transfer in tubes under slip-flow conditions .
the effects of low-density phenomena on the
fully developed heat-transfer characteristics
for laminar flow in tubes has been studied
analytically .  consideration is given to the
slip-flow regime wherein the major rarefaction
effects are manifested as velocity and
temperature jumps at the tube wall .  the
analysis is carried out for both uniform wall
temperature and uniform wall heat flux .
in both cases, the slip-flow nusselt numbers
are lower than those for continuum flow
and decrease with increasing mean free path .
extension of the results is made to include
the effects of shear work at the wall,
temperature jump modifications for a moving fluid,
and thermal creep .

chemical kinetics of high temperature air .
  when a hypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere, a shock
wave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through this
shock wave is heated to high temperatures .  the shock heated
molecules equilibrate their translational and rotational
degrees of freedom within a distance of a few mean free paths .
to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration,
dissociate molecules, produce new molecules and produce ions
and electrons .  the problem is complex, since all these
phenomena occur simultaneously and because the reaction rates depend
on the temperature, density and composition which are changing
during the relaxation toward equilibrium .
  the experimental techniques used to investigate these
reactions are briefly discussed along with the resulting rate
expressions obtained by the various investigators .  a compilation
of the rate expressions for these reactions representing the
author's evaluation of all the available data is presented .
several pertinent problems which are not yet completely
understood and which still require theoretical and experimental
investigation are outlined .  computed concentration, temperature
and density time histories are shown for three different shock
speeds in air .  the time rate of change of concentration for
each chemical reaction is also shown and regimes of importance
for the various processes are discussed .

ablation of glassy materials around blunt bodies of
revolution .
  the steady-state equations of motion for a
thin layer of an incompressible glassy material on the
surface of an ablating and radiating blunt
body are reduced to a first-order ordinary differential
equation which is integrated numerically .
this solution is coupled with the solution of the air
boundary layer for both laminar and turbulent
heat transfer with or without mass vaporization of
the ablating material .  the distribution of the
effective energy of ablation around the body is thus
obtained for a cone cylinder with a hemispherical
cap that re-enters the atmosphere at hypersonic
flight speeds, and has quartz as the ablating
material .  it is found that the ablation process from
turbulent heating is more efficient than from
the laminar case because of increased vaporization .
this solution of the equations of motion at the
stagnation point has been verified by are wind tunnel
experiments .  the present state of development
of the are wind tunnel does not permit its use for
experimental investigations of ablation around
blunt bodies under turbulent heating .

generalized formulas for calculating heat transfer
are given .  graphs for determining the laminar
heat transfer, momentum thickness reynolds

around an axisymmetric body are also given .
these heat transfer correlations are valid for velocities
between 6000 and 26,000 fps and for altitudes
up to 250,000 ft .  this range of velocities and

practical re-entry trajectories having interest today .
in the last section of this report these

closing reply to comments on generalized heat transfer
formulas and graphs for nose cone re-entry into the

in a recent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shown
that, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heat
flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed
the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the
stagnation point .  the ratio of turbulent sonic-point to
laminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has been
estimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 for a hemispherical
nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter)
increases from 10 to 10 .  since for an axisymmetric body
the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly
exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the
ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body
will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat
fluxes per unit area .

  this paper presents numerical results of
exact calculations of the inviscid equilibrium flow about
a long hemisphere-cylinder in motion
at hypersonic velocity .  a comparison is made with blast
wave as well as free layer theories of hypersonic
flow .  as a result of the comparison, it is concluded
that the second-order blast wave theory can
be used for the purpose of finding the shock shape and
the body pressure distribution .  however,
this procedure is definitely empirical and cannot be
justified on rational or theoretical grounds .
we show that the presently calculated radial distribution
of energy is radically different than that
given by blast wave theory .  if body shapes other than
those considered here are of interest, the
only reliable approach at the present time is to carry out
numerical calculations .  it was found
that for certain flight velocities the pressure on the body
does not decay to free stream pressure
monotonically but overexpands .

of a compressible laminar boundary layer .
  an analysis is presented which predicts
the skin-friction and
heat-transfer characteristics of a compressible,
laminar boundary layer on a
solid flat plate preceded by a porous
section that is transpiration cooled .
the analysis is restricted to a prandtl
number of unity and linear
variation of viscosity with temperature .
  the local skin friction has been
found to have a low value in the
region of transpiration cooling and then
to increase until it approaches
the value for a completely nonporous surface
asymptotically .  the initial
increase in local skin friction is rapid
as half of the ultimate increase
occurs in a distance beyond the porous
region that is about 20 percent of
the length of the porous region for all rates
of injection .  when the
total coolant flow rate is kept constant
and the porous length is varied,
it is found that the average skin friction
on a partially porous plate is
slightly lower than that on a fully porous plate .
  the local heat transfer behaves in
a manner similar to that of the
local skin friction .  it is found, in
an example, that the temperature
at the end of a partially porous plate
could be maintained at about the
same temperature as a fully porous plate
by doubling the total rate of
coolant flow .

a geometric problem related to the optimum distribution
of lift on a planar wing in supersonic flow .
  the problem studied may be regarded as a problem of
geometry .  its simplest form (loosely stated) is then as follows ..  a
mountain rises up from the x-y plane .  determine the exact
shape of the mountain knowing only the cross-sectional area of
every possible cut which can be made through the mountain with
a vertical plane .  in a more complicated version of the problem,
the given information might be restricted to the cross-sectional
area of every cut which can be made by a vertical plane inclined
less than 45 to the y-axis .
  this latter case has direct applications to certain minimum
drag problems in supersonic flow .  the shape of the mountain
corresponds to the (unknown) shape of the optimum lift
distribution on a planar wing .  the cross-sectional area of a cut is
the integrated value of the lift along a straight line crossing the
wing plan form .  for a restricted range of line inclinations, these
optimum integrated lift values can sometimes be determined
directly .  here it is assumed that they are given .
  the problem in its simplest form was originally solved by
radon, who found solutions for a large class of such problems .
the derivation presented here may perhaps be more readily

concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar
boundary layers and their separation .
  the theory of compressible flow in a laminar
boundary layer has been developed for the
case when the viscosity is assumed to be
proportional to the absolute temperature and the
prandtl number is unity .  (these assumptions
may be compared with the empirical relations
suggested by cope .)
it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate
normal to the layer can lead to a simplified
form of equation of motion very similar to the
ordinary incompressible equation but modified
by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure
term .  this factor is greater than unity at the
boundary and tends to one at the outside of
the layer .
  several particular solutions are considered
including accelerated flow with a linearly
increasing velocity and retarded flow along a
flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .
  the general implications of the theory are
discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn
when the mainstream velocity starts from
a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and
subsequently falls .  it is concluded that for
such a velocity distribution increasing
compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase
the boundary layer thickness and cause
earlier separation as compared with the incompressible
flow with the same mainstream velocity
distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding
to conditions at the stagnation point .

the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer .

.W
the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer .
  after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements
in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent
boundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear
combination of two universal functions .  one is the well-known
law of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, is
characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment .
these functions are considered to be established empirically, by
a study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any
hypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resulting
complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field,
the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the
boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data .
  the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately
interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly
represents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the
constraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile is
modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is
provided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetrates
the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow
and in the logarithmic profile near the wall .
  finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows
may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions,
considered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wall
component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing
stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied,
is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .

local heat transfer and recovery temperature on a yawed

  local heat transfer, equilibrium temperatures,
and wall static pressures have been measured on a
circular cylinder at yaw angles of 0, 10, 20, 40,
and 60 .  the reynolds number range of the tests
was from 1x10 to 4x10 based on cylinder
diameter .
  increasing the yaw angle from 0 to 40 increased
the stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients by 100
to 180 percent .  a further increase in yaw angle to
heat-transfer coefficients .
  at zero yaw angle the boundary layer over the
entire front half of the cylinder was laminar but at
yaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completely
turbulent, including the stagnation line, as
determined by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficients
with theoretical predictions .  the level of heating
rates and the nature of the chordwise distribution
of heat transfer indicated that a flow mechanism
different from the conventional transitional boundary
layer may have existed at the intermediate yaw angles
of 10 and 20 .  at all yaw angles the peak
heat-transfer coefficient occurred at the stagnation line
and the chordwise distribution of heat-transfer
coefficient decreased monotonically from this peak .
  the average heat-transfer coefficients over the
front half of the cylinder are in agreement with
previous data for a comparable reynolds number
range .
  the theoretical heat-transfer distributions for
both laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
calculated directly from simple quadrature formulas
derived in the present report .

for the infinite cylinder in yaw are
presented .  the chordwise flow in

the effect of a linear
viscosity-temperature relation is compared with
the effect of the sutherland
viscosity-temperature relation at the
stagnation line of the cylinder for a
prandtl number of 0.7 .  the effects of
pressure gradient, mach number, yaw
angle, and wall temperature are
investigated for a linear viscosity-temperature
relation and a prandtl number
of 1.0 with a nonporous wall .
  the results indicate that compressibility
effects become important
at large mach numbers and yaw angles,
with larger percentage effects on
the skin friction than on the heat
transfer .  the use of the two different
viscosity relations gives about the
same results except when large changes
in temperature occur across the boundary
layer, as for a highly cooled
wall .  the present solutions predict that
a larger amount of coolant would

drag coefficients over the front side
of the cylinder .  for example, at

reduced by yaw, but the amount of
reduction is small compared to the
reduction in heat-transfer coefficients .

an experimental investigation of leading edge shock wave boundary layer
interaction at mach 5.8 .
the boundary layer on a slender body tends to be very thick at
hypersonic speeds . it interacts with the external flow by producing larger
flow deflections near the leading edge than those due to the body alone
flow around the boundary layer gives rise to an induced pressure with a
negative gradient which thins the boundary layer and increases the skin
friction with respect to the zero pressure gradient value .
experiments on a flat plate with a sharp leading edge have been
performed in the galcit 5-dash by 5-dash in. mach 5.8 hypersonic wind
tunnel . the induced pressure was measured by means of orifices in the
plate surface . profiles of mach number, velocity, mass flow, pressure,
and momentum deficiency were calculated from impact pressure surveys
normal to the plate surface made at various distances from the leading
edge .
the results are as follows . /1/ the induced pressures are 25 per cent
higher than the weak interaction theory . /2/ the boundary layer and the
 external flow are distinctly separate for as low as 6,000 . /3/ the
shock wave location is in good agreement with that predicted by the
friedrichs theory for a body shape equivalent to the observed
boundary-layer displacement thickness . /4/ expansion waves reflected from the
shock are weak . /5/ the average skin-friction coefficient tends toward
and nearly matches the zero pressure gradient value downstream, but
increases to approximately twice that value as the leading edge is

rates for a sharp leading edge flat plate .  the free

boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high
temperature hypersonic flow .
two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies
are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large
down-stream influence of leading-edge bluntness . the present paper
contributes new theoretical and experimental results on this problem .
the interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending
 the basic shock-layer concept . in the outer inviscid flow, a model
consisting of a detached shock layer and an entropy layer is introduced
to account for bluntness . in the boundary layer, the approximate
solution is found to be governed by a local flat-plate similarity . under
the assumption of a strong bow shock and a specific heat ratio close to
unity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body . for flat-plate
 afterbodies, the theory yields a solution agreeing with blast-wave
theory at one limit and strong-interaction theory at the other . within
the framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle of
attack are also analyzed . complementary to the above study, a
hypersonic similitude involving strong shocks, but not requiring close to one
 a natural comparison with experimental data correlated on the basis of
this similitude .
flat-plate experiments in air, conducted in the c.a.l. 11 x 15-dashin.
hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall conditions, included measurement
 of surface heat-transfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero
and nonzero angle of attack . steady laminar heat-transfer rates were
measured by means of thin-film resistance thermometers at air test-flow
mach numbers around 12, free-stream reynolds numbers from 1.4 x 10 to 1.
for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from
ratios of about 0.15 . the range of test conditions at this stagnation
temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and
dominant viscous-interaction effects . heat-transfer distributions were
also measured on a sharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging
from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreek .
the experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the
foregoing theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects
of boundary-layer displacement and bluntness . the correlations obtained
 suggest that for the present experimental conditions, at least, the
hypersonic viscous similitude is valid even with leading-edge bluntness
 in the paper, is generally fair .

viscous hypersonic similitude .
  an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developed
which takes into account the interaction effect of the
displacement thickness of the boundary layer .  a basic result of this
viscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional drag
obeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag .
additional similarity conditions governing viscous effects must be
imposed in this similitude .
  underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layer
independence principle .  according to this principle, the
principal part of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressure
and wall temperature distributions and free-stream total
enthalpy is independent of the (high) external mach number
distribution outside the boundary layer .
  various features of viscous hypersonic similitudes are
discussed .  it is found, for example, that it applies to three-
dimensional boundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, provided
the concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided the
aspect ratio is an invariant .

inviscid flow with nonequilibrium molecular dissociation for pressure
distributions encountered in hypersonic flight .
one-dimensional inviscid nonequilibrium flows of a two-component model
gas are studied for prescribed pressure variations and an average
reaction rate based on recent data for oxygen recombination . these flows
are interpreted in relation to the flow along streamlines around blunt
hypersonic bodies . assuming equilibrium conditions in the subsonic
region, it is estimated that the flow in the initial supersonic
expansion region, which is approximately of prandtl-meyer character, will be
chemically frozen with respect to the molecular dissociation of the
primary components under the hypersonic, high-altitude flight conditions
 considered . the flight conditions consist of flight velocities between
furthermore, on bodies of small surface inclination beyond the nose, the
 flow will continue to be effectively frozen for at least 20 ft
down-stream of the nose . these conclusions may lead to the simplification of
 procedures for theoretical calculation and testing .
the problem of distinguishing a dimensionless length-reaction rate
parameter, which characterizes the extent of departures from equilibrium or
 from frozen behavior in the flow fields of interest here, is discussed

atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle .
the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is
 considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved
numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of
different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that
deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the
rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once
such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the
dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is
expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section .
 an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of
sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the
problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of
 conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted,
then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working
sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an
optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from
equilibrium .
it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected
 by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed
slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated
 to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing
occurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more
sensitive to departures from equilibrium .

viscous and inviscid stagnation flow in a dissociated hypervelocity free
 stream .
high reynolds number hypersonic stagnation flow over a blunt-nosed body
in a nonequilibrium dissociated free stream is analyzed and compared to
a similar flow in an initially undissociated ambient gas . free stream
dissociation effects on various equilibrium stagnation flow properties
in air are presented as a function of the ambient atom mass fraction and
 dissociation energy for velocities ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 fps .
significant changes in the bow shock geometry, stagnation gas state, and
 boundary layer behavior are found when the free stream dissociation
involves more than 10( of the total energy . it is observed that for
large amounts of both atomic oxygen and nitrogen ahead of the body, the
equilibrium shock layer properties converge toward those pertaining to
chemically and vibrationally-frozen flow across the bow shock .
moreover, under certain conditions, the ionization level can be increased by
 an order of magnitude and the usual reduction in frozen boundary layer
heat transfer due to a highly-cooled noncatalytic surface can increase
from stall of adjacent stages .
the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed
operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that
such compromises would severely reduce the complete-compressor-stall
margin . furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred
from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible
to abrupt-stall characteristics .
the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance
characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to
part-speed compressor performance . these characteristics must, however,
 be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of
the multistage compressor . alleviation of part-speed operational
problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or
stage loading margin .
the results of this analysis are only qualitative . the trends obtained,
 however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies
 of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the
results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design
problem . in addition to these stage-matching studies, a general

  lagrangian methods in heat-flow problems and transport
phenomena were introduced by the writer in some previous work .
the present paper develops further one particular aspect of the
method,--i.e., the elimination of /ignorable coordinates ./  this
is accomplished by a special choice of generalized coordinates,
each of which is constituted by an arbitrary temperature
distribution and an /associated flow field ./  the latter is a vector
field which is derived from the corresponding scalar field by a
variational method .  the procedure is valid for a certain class of
nonlinear problems, provided we replace the temperature by the heat
content as the unknown .  it is shown that for normal coordinates
derivation of the associated flow field is immediate .  the use
of normal coordinates and their associated flow fields is
illustrated by an example .  introduction of dirac functions and
associated flow fields yields a procedure which constitutes a
generalization of the classical formulation by green's functions
and integral equations .  this is illustrated by application to
one-dimensional problems of heating of a homogeneous or composite
slab and directly verified by classical methods in the appendix .

new thermo-mechanical reciprocity relations with application
to thermal stress analysis .
  based on the variational formulation of linear
thermodynamics as developed previously by the writer, thermomechanical
reciprocity relations are discussed which lead to new methods of
analysis of thermal stresses .  these reciprocity relations are quite
different from the usual ones derived from the analogy of thermal
loading with a combination of surface and body-force distribution .
the results are applicable to stationary and transient
temperatures in elastic and viscoelastic structures .  the methods are
entirely variational and do not require the evaluation of the
temperature field .  the stresses at one point are expressed
directly in terms of any arbitrary distribution temperatures applied
externally, including the effect of surface heat-transfer layer .
the concepts and procedures are illustrated on a simple
example .  the relation is pointed out between the reciprocity
property and the generalization of castigliano's principle to
thermomechanics .

influence coefficients for real gases .
in the analysis of one-dimensional fluid-flow problems, it is often
assumed that the behavior of the medium is that of a perfect gas .
this assumption is justified, provided the pressure and temperature
range of interest is small and near atmospheric .  at higher pressures
and temperatures various deviations are introduced thereby causing
deviations from the results obtained by using the ideal fluid-flow
equations .
in this note, influence coefficients, similar to those developed by
shapiro, are presented for the case of real gases .  this analysis is
based upon the use of various functions of the compressibility factor
emmons .  some of the assumptions made were as follows..  (1) the flow
is one-dimensional and steady, (2) changes in the stream properties
are continuous, and (3) the flow is comprised of imperfect gases

variational analysis of ablation .
the variational and lagrangian thermodynamics developed in earlier
publications are directly applicable to problems of heat conduction
with melting boundaries .  these techniques are used here in treating
the problem of a half-space subjected to a constant rate of heat input
at the melting surface (fig. 1) .
the applicability of the lagrangian equations to this case follows
from the fact that the basic variational principle is valid whether the
boundaries are fixed or move as arbitrary functions of time .  this
can be seen if we remember that the equations govern only the
instantaneous configuration of the flow rates for a given geometry and
temperature field .

compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled .
an analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio
ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means of a
simplified stage-stacking study .  the principal problems considered
were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance
characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor
surge or stall-limit characteristics . the analysis indicated that all
these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance
characteristics of the front stages . such discontinuities can be due
to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance
resulting from stall of adjacent stages .
  the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed

compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin .
furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the

some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors .
observations of rotating stall have shown that a wide variety
of stall patterns is possible .
     hot-wire anemometer data on a multistage compressor have
shown a progressive-type stall at low speeds . the amplitude
of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first
few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the
latter stages . a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating
stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low
speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with
compressor surge at high speeds .
     blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by
rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage
compressors .
      in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage
performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages
was considered . in general, the pressure drop at the stall point
is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical
formulation of compressor performance . compressor surge is
attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall
point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in
jet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may
result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic
characteristics of compressor surge . in this event, engine operation
will be limited because of the large drop in performance which
accompanies compressor stall  .

the equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operation .
  a modified technique for the operation of a gun tunnel is
suggested based on experimental results .  if the piston mass and the
initial barrel pressure are chosen correctly, then the peak pressures
associated with the gun tunnel may be eliminated .  under these
conditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswing .  some
measurements of the piston motion using a microwave technique are
reported which confirm this idea .
  the wave diagram associated with this mode of operation is
shown, and some calculations of the stagnation pressure are given which
show that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressure
may be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving
chamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven
section .  for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always
be less than the driving pressure .  the use of air, helium and
hydrogen as driving gases has been considered .
  experiments in a gun tunnel are reported which show that the
equilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to be
achieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving
gas .  the expansion caused by the piston acceleration is shown to
interact with the stationary piston, but this is found to produce only a
small drop in stagnation pressure .

aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivatives
for slender bodies of general cross section .
  the problem of determining the total
forces, moments, and stability
derivatives for a slender body performing
slow maneuvers in a compressible
fluid is treated within the assumptions
of slender-body theory .  general
expressions for the total forces (except
drag) and moments are developed
in terms of the geometry and motions of
the airplane, and formulas for
the stability derivatives are derived in
terms of the mapping functions
of the cross sections .
  all components of the motion are
treated simultaneously and second
derivatives as well as first are obtained,
with respect to both the
motion components and their time rates of
change .  coupling of the
longitudinal and lateral motions is thus
automatically included .  a number of
general relationships among the various
stability derivatives are found
which are independent of the configuration,
so that, at most, only 35
of a total of 325 first and second
derivatives need be calculated
directly .  calculations of stability
derivatives are carried out for two
triangular wings with camber and thickness,
one with a blunt trailing
edge, and for two wing-body combinations, one having a plane wing and
vertical fin .
  the influence on the stability
derivatives of the squared terms in
the pressure relation is demonstrated,
and the apparent mass concept as
applied to slender-body theory is discussed
at some length in the light
of the present analysis .  it is shown that
the stability derivatives can
be calculated by apparent mass although the
general expressions for the
total forces and moments involve additional terms .

the calculation of lateral stability derivatives of
slender wings at incidence including fin effectiveness,
and correlation with experiment .
  comparisons are made between
low-speed experimental results and
estimates based on attached-flow
theory for the lateral stability
derivatives of slender wings at
incidence, and it is found that the flow
separation has little effect on
the sideslip derivatives .  the reduction
in due to part-span anhedral
is evaluated, and a semi-empirical formula
is derived to account for important
second-order terms .  for the rotary
derivatives, an attempt is made
to estimate the effect of the leading edge
vortices, but no satisfactory
conclusions have been reached .
  the fin contributions to
the derivatives are evaluated on the basis
of treating the wing surface as
a total reflection plate .  good agreement
with experiment is reached for
the sideslip derivatives, and for the
damping-in-yaw at moderate incidences .
sidewash is found to have a large
effect on the rolling derivatives,
and further information on the strength
and position of the leading edge
vortices in non-symmetric flow is required
before a complete calculation of
the sidewash can be given .

calculation of the flow past slender delta wings with
leading edge separation .
  the flow past a slender delta
wing with a sharp leading edge, at
incidence, usually separates along
this edge, i.e. a vortex layer extends
from the edge and rolls up to form
a /core/ (a region of high vorticity) .
a potential flow model of this is
constructed in which the layer is
replaced by a vortex sheet which
is rolled up into a spiral in the region
of the /core/ .  this problem
is reduced to a two-dimensional one by
assuming a conical field and using
slender wing theory .  the shape and strength
of the sheet are determined by
the two conditions that it is a stream
surface and sustains no pressure
difference .  use is made of results
previously obtained for the core
region and the remaining finite part of
the sheet is dealt with by choosing
certain functions for its shape and
strength .  the parameters in these
functions are found by satisfying the
two conditions stated above at
isolated points .  results are obtained for
the pressure distribution, chord
loading and norman force coefficient as
functions of the ratio of the
incidence to the apex angle .  the lift for a
given incidence is about 15
below that found by brown and michael .  flow
patterns are indicated in two
typical cases .  the effect of separation on
the drag due to lift of a wing
with small thickness is discussed .

part ii. heater performance .
tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mounted
horizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operation
at m=6.8 and probably adequate for flows at m=8.2 with the existing
nozzles .  in its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680
degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnel
because of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater and
quick-acting valve which form, in effect, a large heat sink .  because of this
heat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperature
in the working section at the start of a run .  it is hoped to cure this
by preheating the heater outlet cone and the quick-acting valve .
at pressures greater than about 100 p.s.i.g. free convection through the
fibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the top
of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, which
results in /hogging/ distortion of the shell .  this free convection
cools the heater core and a vertical temperature gradient is set up
across it after only a few minutes at high pressure .
modifications to be incorporated in the heater to improve its
performance are described .

pressure measurements were made on a slender cone-cylinder-flare
configuration, slightly blunted at the nose, for 0, 3 and 6 degrees
incidence at a free-stream mach number of 6.8 .
it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed with
 extrapolations to m equals 6.8 of theoretical values given in m.i.t.
tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gave a good
indication of the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the body

developed upstream on the cone surface .
no evidence of a marked over-expansion to pressures below the

formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed
flight .
this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for making
preliminary estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight .
the formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximation
which has given good agreement with theoretical and experimental
evidence . in the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with
 an analogue computer or a step-by-step method of integration to
predict the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with time .
in the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number,
simple analytical methods and results are given which include the
effects of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skins
where h is the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g, d and k are the
heat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skin . if 0.1
the skin is approximately /thin/, i.e. temperature gradients across its
thickness may be neglected .

aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels .
hot-wire measurements in the free stream of a supersonic wind tunnel
were made in the mach number range of 1.6 to 5.0 . it is shown that the
mass-flow fluctuations increase very rapidly with increasing mach
number . if the fluctuation field is assumed to consist of sound waves-dash
an assumption that is consistent with the measurements-dashthe sound
intensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of the
experiments . furthermore, the orientation of the field is found to be
different from the mach line direction,. it corresponds to a
sound-source velocity of approximately one-half the free-stream velocity for
the higher mach numbers . it is shown that the turbulent boundary layer
along the nozzle and the tunnel walls is responsible for this sound
field .

  the three-dimensional incompressible flow of fluid along the corner of

interference of the boundary layers of the two plates, is discussed .
mainly, the more important case of turbulent boundary layer is treated
by means of experimental studies carried out at the technical university
of braunschweig .  some theoretical results for laminar flow are also
taken into account .
  in order to describe the interference effects in the boundary layer,
an interference displacement thickness and an interference skin friction
have been introduced .  it is shown from experiments and also from
theoretical considerations how these two quantities depend on reynolds
number .  furthermore, the influence of interference on the transition
from laminar to turbulent flow is investigated .  in addition, some

an approximate solution of the compressible laminar
boundary layer on a flat plate .
  following a major assumption that enthalpy and velocity are dependent
only on local conditions, an enthalpy-velocity relation
is obtained for the laminar boundary layer on a flat plate where
subscripts p refer to the plate, 1 to the free stream and e to the
equilibrium temperature condition at the plate .  when compared with
general results, this relation (exact for prandtl number o = 1)
gives a close approximation to crocco's numerical results for o = 0.725
and 1.25, up to .
  using the above relation in conjunction with the approximate
viscosity-temperature relation suggested by chapman and rubesin, and
with young's suggested first approximation for shearing stress it is
shown that close approximations to displacement thickness and velocity
distribution are given by and where and which serves to define c .
  these have the advantage of being algebraic in form whereas previous
results have involved complex numerical integrations for individual
cases .

orbit decay and prediction of the motion of artificial satellites .
the rate of decay of elliptic satellite orbits, due to atmospheric drag,
 is investigated through variation of parameters and through use of an
atmospheric model involving a power function between density and

exponential function .
the effects of the equatorial belt and the rotation of the earth are
investigated . the conclusion is reached that through these anomalies
atmospheric drag substantially affects the orbit elements, especially
those defining the orbit plane .
an alternate approach of variation of parameters is presented, by which
a direct relation between period decay and instantaneous density
conditions is established . this approach, by itself specifically adequate
for prediction work, also opens an avenue for systematic and unified
evaluation of observed decay .

exact form of this curve has now been derived . corrections for the
 is excellent .
very close correlation between atmospheric density variations/h180 km./
and the solar 20-cm. radiation implies that the origin of the'solar

the atmospheric density curve between 180 and 200 km. shows a
temperature inversion in the fl-layer . it is not yet possible to decide
 whether solar ultra-violet radiation as well as the solar he line and
solar x-ray radiation contribute to the heating of the fl-layer .
diurnal and seasonal density variations at altitudes 210, 562 and 660

variations are taken from different dates within the period

density variation at 210 km. is only a few per cent . absorption of

scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite

the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of the
rate at which air density p varies with height y, being given by
h-p//dp/dy/ . the value of h, although important because/with the
molecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has not
as yet been well determined at heights above 200 km .
this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a
satellite's perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital period
of a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit . these methods are then
applied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose . the 44
 values of h obtained, for heights of 200-450 km, represent an average
over day and night and probably have errors/s.d./of 5-10( . it is found
that, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreased
greatly ..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to
height becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the
 supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km,
for 1959-61 . the results could be greatly extended in scope and
improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for
short-lifetime satellites .

on the coupling between heat and mass transfer .
in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituent
will migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, and
the other toward the colder parts .  this phenomenon, known
as the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, were
discovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively .  the two
effects can also be considered as a simultaneous transport of
mass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer .
the effects of this coupling have been neglected in all
investigations of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far,
on the a priori assumption that they are small .  in a recent
publication however, it was shown that they can be large in
laminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection .
turbulent-boundary-layer measurements and an analysis conducted
at the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significant
effects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic wall
temperature .  from additional measurements, the results of which
are presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at the
model wall into one part depending on the temperature gradient
and a second part caused by the coupling .  it is shown that
the latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may not
be neglected a priori without careful consideration .

cruise performance of channel-flow ground effect machines .
  the performance theory for high-speed air-cushion vehicles
operating in close proximity to the ground is developed .  the
analysis is restricted to cruise flight of vehicles of rectangular
planform employing an air pressure seal between the ground and
the vehicle along the two streamwise sides .  the variation of
the optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressure
seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure and
maximum range is found .  it is concluded that a mixed
propulsion system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is required .
volume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed are
also calculated .  the maximum lift drag ratio is determined .
  the maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are considered
to be large compared with the ground-height vehicle-length
ratio .  two-dimensional airfoil theory is employed to show that
close to stagnation conditions exist below the vehicles .  the
lower-surface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamic-center
location are determined .
  the flow over the upper surface is identified with flow over
mounds .  upper-surface lift coefficients are determined for
typical mound shapes .
  it is shown that high total lift coefficients are theoretically
obtainable with almost zero induced drag .  the conventional
induced-drag power penalty is replaced by a sealing-air power
expenditure, which is shown not to be excessive .

viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flows .
  the condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of
dissociated species of air at the equilibrium value behind the
shock envelope prevails over a major portion of the flight
spectrum associated with lifting re-entry vehicles .  this is observed
by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits
of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the
constituents of air .  accordingly, investigations of the viscous and
inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge
slender bodies are made .  the investigations are generalized to
consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free
stream .  this condition is included in order to allow comparison
with the flow field about a model in the test section of a
hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free
stream .
  inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and
sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometries .  the
results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in
inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy),
is considerably diminished for this model .  this conclusion is
verified numerically by a characteristics solution for the
hypersonic flow about a /sonic-wedge/ slab .
  the viscous investigations consider the boundary-layer
interaction problem with a frozen degree of dissociation .  in
this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is
observed to be the ratio of the
dissociation energy to the free-stream kinetic energy .  the
influence of this parameter on the boundary-layer interaction
mechanism for a highly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presented .
the influence of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat
transfer is also discussed .
  finally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated
in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects
are present, the possibility of employing expansions with a
controlled degree of dissociation as a technique for aerodynamic
simulation is presented .

some features of supersonic and hypersonic flow about
blunted cones .
  for a family of cones of various semiapex angles blunted by
spherical caps, shock shapes and surface pressure distributions
have been obtained from both the belotserkovskii method and
experiment .  these results are used to study convergence to
conical flow .  conditions leading to both overexpansion and
underexpansion on the surface with respect to the asymptotic
conical pressures are described as well as conditions leading to
bow shock inflection points .  conditions also exist for which a
second shock may occur, or for which the sonic line cannot touch
the body surface .  the implications of these conditions for
various blunt-body methods are discussed .  for cones blunted
in such a manner as to keep the flow entirely supersonic, the flow
field is found to exhibit certain similarities with that for genuine
blunting .  this is related to the fact that the surface entropy
layer for blunt bodies can be most influential, in determining
surface pressure, in the interior of the flow field rather than near
the surface .

flutter analysis of circular panels .
  the flutter problem of flat circular panels with edges elastically
restrained against rotation has been formulated in terms of
small-deflection plate theory .  the panel is subjected to uniform
all-round tension or compression in its middle plane, in addition to
the supersonic compressible flow passing over its upper surface
with still air below .  linear piston theory is employed to predict
the aerodynamic load on the vibrating panel .
  the problem is investigated by a rayleigh-type analysis
involving chosen modes of the panel as degrees of freedom .
  in order to investigate the convergence of the solution, the
flutter-mode shape of the clamped-edge panel has been expressed
in a series form in powers of r cos o .  the results of three-, four-,
and five-term approximations have displayed oscillatory
behavior with apparently rapid convergence of the solution .

thermal effects on a transpiration cooled hemisphere .
  an approximate method is used to obtain the
injection distribution which would exist on an isothermal,
transpiration-cooled hemisphere in a supersonic stream .
this distribution is the same for both air and helium
injection, and is independent of the blowing level .  a
model having this distribution was tested in the naval
supersonic laboratory wind tunnel at a mach number
of 3.53 .  it is concluded that the design technique is
reasonably accurate .  data taken near the nose are
compared with the theories for air and helium
injection .  the agreement in the case of the reduction in
heat-transfer coefficient is good .  the values of
insulated wall temperature obtained near the nose with
helium injection are 8 percent above the local
stagnation temperature, and largely independent of injection
rate .  it is believed that this phenomenon may be
attributed to the thermal diffusion of the helium within
the boundary layer .  air injection causes a slight
reduction in the insulated wall temperature .  it is shown
that injection of either air or helium at the hemisphere
nose considerably reduces the heat flux at the surface .
the additional reduction in heat flux resulting from
helium injection as opposed to air injection, and
predicted by existing theory, is largely absent .

second-order effects in laminar boundary layers .
  second-order boundary layer disturbances are
due to the displacement of the main flow by
the boundary layer, surface curvature, freestream
vorticity, and slip .  a procedure for finding
these is given for compressible flow of a perfect gas
having a classically similar boundary layer .
solutions are given for the flat plate and circular
cylinder and for the hypersonic axisymmetric
stagnation point .  for the latter flow, the dominant
effect is that of vorticity, which increases
both shear and heat flux .  for the plate or cylinder,
the same conclusion tends to hold for high
speed flow .  the vorticity effect is governed by the
entire outer flow--not just the wall vorticity .

  paper describes results of numerical solution of the viscous
shock-layer equations for axisymmetric stagnation region, using
the viscosity-temperature law with w=0.65, pr=0.71 and
y=1.25 .  purpose is to establish applicability of the simple
approximation of w=1 (obtained earlier) to air at low reynolds
numbers and low ratios of wall temperature to stagnation
temperature .  using a reference temperature (closely equal to
eckert's) to interpret the linear results, excellent agreement is found,
in the limit of, over a wide range of reynolds numbers,
covering fully merged shock layers as well as boundary layers
with and without vorticity interaction .  agreement with recent
experiments of ferri et al is as good as to be expected from
shock-layer approximation .  paper provides valuable extension of the
applicability of the reference temperature concept .

an experimental investigation has been made to indicate the validity of
using methane-air combustion products as the test medium for aerodynamic
heating and loading tests .  tests were conducted on a
hemisphere-cylinder and on a bluff-afterbody model, both in methane-air combustion
products and in air alone, and covered a range of mach numbers from 6 to
the data showed that the nondimensional heating-rate distribution
along a hemisphere-cylinder as obtained in combustion products was in
good agreement with that obtained in air, and the results were in
reasonable agreement with theory .  the stagnation-point heating rates
in air and in combustion products over the hemisphere-cylinder agreed
within 10 percent of the theoretical values .  the pressure
distributions around a hemisphere-cylinder obtained from tests in combution
products were in good agreement with those obtained in air and could
be predicted by newtonian flow theory .  the tests in combustion
products of a bluff-afterbody model produced nondimensional
heat-transfer coefficients which were in fair agreement with results
obtained in air .

pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a free-stream
mach number of 1.39 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream .
an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on
a flat plate at a free-stream mach number of 1.39 by a supersonic
rocket jet exhausting upstream and downstream .  measurements of the
pressure distribution on a flat plate were made at zero angle of
attack for 11 different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath
the wing .  measurements were made at ratios of rocket-exit total
pressure to free-stream static pressure from 6 to 60 and at a reynolds
number per foot of approximately 10 times 10 to the power of 6 .  the
rocket when exhausted upstream produced a strong shock that moved
further upstream with increasing rocket-exit total-pressure ratio .
positive incremental normal-force coefficients were obtained at all test
positions .  data at 11 test positions are tabulated for rocket-on
and rocket-off pressure coefficients as well as for incremental pressure
coefficients for the 48 orifices of the flat plate for the range of
ratio of rocket-exit total pressure to free-stream static pressure
of the investigation .  changing the location of the model with
respect to the plate had a negligible effect when the rocket was
varied in the chordwise direction, but the pressure coefficients
were reduced as the rocket was lowered away from the flat-plate wing .

longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic

  an investigation has been conducted
in the langley 7- by 10-foot transonic
tunnel at low subsonic speeds to determine
the longitudinal aerodynamic
characteristics associated with deflection of the
nose section of a highly swept delta
wing having an aspect ratio of 1.33 .  in order
to illustrate the effectiveness of
this forward control, the longitudinal control
characteristics are also presented
for the wing with upper-and lower-surface
split flaps located at the trailing
edge .
  comparison between the longitudinal
aerodynamic characteristics of the wing
utilizing the nose control and those of
the wing utilizing the upper-surface
split flap located at the trailing edge
indicated similar control effectiveness
for high control deflections (15) and
similar values of trimmed lift-drag ratio
with increasing lift coefficient .  use
of the nose control, however, indicated a
lower value of trimmed angle of attack
for a given value of trimmed lift
coefficient than that realized from use of
the upper-surface split flap .  further
reductions in trimmed angle of attack
for a given value of trimmed lift
coefficient may be realized from deflection
of the lower-surface split flap at the
wing trailing edge in combination with
the nose control and would be accompanied
by large reductions in lift-drag ratio .

.W
the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue .
the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue demands a
knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one
hand to metal physics at the other . at the present time the various
aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know
quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made . never-
the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of
construction in noise environments can be used with a limited
amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of
structure . this approach to the problem is adopted in this
lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the
moment . it must be emphasized, however, that although some
progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a
structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life
of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype
strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if
one is to prove the integrity of the design .
     within the structural limits of single skin construction set in
this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no
reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing
board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of
behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical
simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been
possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by
stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib
for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin
intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet .
     the most resonable basis for the future estimation of
fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n
curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the
necessary test data .
     the life expectation of a new design will be uncertain and
some proof testing is essential if the integrity of structure in high
noise levels (150 db) is to be guaranteed .

numerical results for deflections, slope components, bending and
twisting moments, and transverse distributed shears are presented

thermal diffusion effects on energy transfer in a turbulent
boundary layer with helium injection .
  a circular cylinder with two-inch
diameter and with a porous wall
fabricated out of woven wire material was
aligned with its axis parallel to an air
stream with approximately 100 ft sec
velocity .  helium gas was injected into
the turbulent boundary layer through
the cylinder walls at a uniform rate in
the range 1.55 x 10 to 1.08 x 10
of the free stream mass velocity .  the
local energy transfer along the cylinder
was measured at various values of
the wall temperature level for the
situation that the energy flows from the
cylinder to the boundary layer and
vice versa .  the results showed clearly
that the wall temperature for zero
energy transfer - the adiabatic wall
temperature - was larger than the free
stream temperature by up to about 40 f,
although viscous dissipation effects
are negligible .  this temperature excess
increases with increasing injection
rate and is independent of reynolds
number .
  an analysis in which the laminar
sublayer is treated as couette flow
with helium injection and which includes
thermal diffusion in this layer is
formulated .  the results show appreciable
thermal diffusion effects on
adiabatic wall temperature, increasing it
over its value for zero injection
by amounts of the same order of magnitude
as found by measurements .  thermal
diffusion however has negligible effects
on the heat transfer coefficient .
its effects on the concentration and
temperature distribution are discussed
and are shown to produce appreciable
modifications in the latter .

the hovercraft - a new concept in maritime transport .
  the hovercraft is the first operational british
project in the ground-effect machine field .
although there has, for a number of years, been
a tentative searching after the principles
underlying such machines, it is only now that their
possibilities as commercial transport and
service craft are beginning to be developed .
  since the hovercraft is a new vehicle, the appearance
of the saunders-roe sr-n1, a manned
experimental craft, excited considerable public attention
and there have been a number of
descriptive articles in the press .  papers of a more
technical type, on ground-effect machines,
are now beginning to appear and it is to be expected
that these will rapidly increase in number,
especially since american interest in both the commercial
and defence fields is expanding fast .
  the authors of the present paper have, therefore,
concentrated attention upon features
about which they had something personal to say, and
which they consider to be of particular
significance for assessing the possibility of the
hovercraft becoming important in maritime
transport .  these features
are ..-    the hovercraft as a fundamentally new
      principle in the transport field .
    the powering requirements and resistance
      characteristics .
    the likely operating costs of hovercraft
      in comparison with other forms of maritime transport .
in addition, relatively brief descriptions of
the history and the current work being undertaken

heat transfer to separated and reattached subsonic
turbulen flows obtained downstream of a surface step .
  local heat-transfer coefficients and recovery factors are
presented for separated and reattached turbulent flows as obtained
by a downward step in an otherwise flat surface in a two-
dimensional, subsonic, air flow .  the region downstream of the step,
the focus of this investigation, contained a region of separated
flow with reattachment at about five step heights downstream,
followed by a section of reattached flow .  the salient feature of
the results is the maximum in the local heat-transfer coefficient
at the reattachment point, with values thereof diminishing in the
separated region and also in the reattached region, where they
tend toward values characteristic of turbulent boundary-layer
flow .  it is found that for most of the region the heat-transfer
coefficient depends on the velocity to about the 0.8 power, though
a decreased dependence may exist in the separated region .
recovery factors have the characteristically low values associated
with separated flows, and do not attain values typical of
turbulent boundary-layer flows within the downstream lengths
available .

transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow .
  parallel flow of an electrically conducting viscous
incompressible fluid in a rectangular duct with
transverse magnetic field is considered .  the walls
of the duct which are parallel and perpendicular
to the imposed magnetic field are taken to be
nonconducting and perfectly conducting, respectively .
assuming the fluid to be at rest at the initial
moment, exact solutions for the velocity and magnetic
field components are obtained in the form of
convolution integrals taking the longitudinal pressure
gradient as an arbitrary given function of time .
later, taking a step function for the pressure gradient,
these expressions are integrated .  for this case,
the effect of the strength of the imposed magnetic
field on the development behavior of the flow is
studied .  it is found that except for very large magnetic
fields, the flows are over damped .

departure from dissociation equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzle .
the equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gas
through a nearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assuming
a simple equation for the rate of dissociation, and a number of
different values of the rate constant . the results of these
calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will
occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range
of values . they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun the
gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will
remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it
passes through a constant area test section . an approximate method
of solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow,
 has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the
deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if all
the assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack of
dissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of
hypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubes .
it is shown, however, that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a
 wind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may take
place in the nozzle upstream of the shock wave . even so, the stand-off
distance of a shock wave in front of a blunt model may be quite
sensitive to deviations from equilibrium .

review of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noise
part i..  panel flutter .
with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibration
of panels has become a problem of practical significance .  many
of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic
speed have been attributed to the development of such panel
oscillations .  it appears this
phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic
speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop
oscillations which cause instability of the structure .  this effect has
been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions
motion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem .
in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its
effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of
the panel material .
the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force
induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or
buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow) .
the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually
referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers
in recent years .  since the problem is too complex to be dealt with
in its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in these
investigations .  the literature is marked by a certain degree of
controversy over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability of
the results obtained .  a brief review of the literature with reference
to several of the approximations made and the results obtained follows .

the author points out a fundamental difficulty in the

would occur if the basic flow were uniform) ..  slow
attenuation of the secondary-flow disturbance with distance
from the obstacle .  the author conjectured (same j. 1
the trouble was caused by nonuniform validity of the
approximation sequence in the region far from the
obstacle .  the analogy with /stokes' and whitehead's
paradoxes/ is mentioned, and a solution analogous to
oseen's is suggested, one in which disturbances, but not
the shear, are assumed to be small .  in this paper, such a
solution is found, and is shown to overlap with the
small-shear, secondary-flow solution .  the basic flow is a parallel,
steady, inviscid, two-dimensional shear flow .  the /
fundamental solution/ due to a weak source is sought .
  the method of fourier transforms is used .  simple
solutions are found for a uniformly sheared basic flow (where
the result coincides with the secondary-flow solution) and
for an exponential basic-flow profile .  in the general case
it is assumed that the parallel basic flow becomes uniform
at, where the x-axis lies in the flow direction .
the character of the solution is determined by studying
its hankel transform, especially for the class of flows
where the total variation of the basic stream speed v(y)
is small .  an interpretation in terms of images, due to
m. b. glauert, is given, and finally the relationship of the

for wedge-type flow, useful in estimating
heat transfer to such

following cases ..  (1) small
temperature changes in the boundary layer
along a constant- and along a
variable-temperature wall, and (2) large
temperature changes in the boundary layer
along a constant-temperature wall .
  dimensionless forms of heat-transfer
and friction parameters and
boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated .
the results indicate that
coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall
temperature ratios diminished
the friction and heat transfer for a
constant wall temperature .  for a
variable wall temperature with small
temperature differences in the
boundary layer, the friction was unaffected,
but the heat transfer was greatly
increased for increased wall-temperature
gradient .  heat-transfer results
in the literature reveal that transpiration
cooling is much more effective
for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .

.W
theoretical and experimental investigation of
aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on
a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic
mach numbers .
  the effect of a strong, negative
pressure gradient upon the local
rate of heat transfer through a laminar
boundary layer on the isothermal
surface of an electrically heated,
cylindrical body of revolution with a
hemispherical nose was determined from
wind-tunnel tests at a mach number
of 1.97 .  the investigation indicated
that the local heat-transfer
parameter, based on flow conditions
just outside the boundary layer,
decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at
the stagnation point of the
hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the
junction with the cylindrical
afterbody .  because measurements of the
static pressure distribution over
the hemisphere indicated that the local
flow pattern tended to become
stationary as the free-stream mach number
was increased to 3.8, this
distribution of heat-transfer parameter is
believed representative of all
mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of
temperatures less than that of
dissociation .  the local heat-transfer
parameter was independent of reynolds
number based on body diameter in the
range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .
  the measured distribution of
heat-transfer parameter agreed within
theoretical distribution calculated with
foreknowledge only of the pressure
distribution about the body .  this
method, applicable to any body of
revolution with an isothermal surface,
combines the mangler transformation,
stewartson transformation, and thermal
solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow
problem, and thus evaluates the
heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric
compressible flow in terms of the known
heat-transfer rate in an approximately
equivalent two-dimensional
incompressible flow .
  measurements of recovery-temperature
distributions at mach numbers
of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery
factors having an average value
of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which
increased abruptly at the shoulder
to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on
the cylindrical afterbody .  this
result suggests that the usual representation
of the laminar recovery
factor as the square root of the prandtl
number is conservative in the
presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .

flow can be approximately represented by an inviscid-flow solution
having as boundary conditions the body shape, which is not affected by

hypersonic shock layer theory of the stagnation region at low reynolds

cheng, h.k.
hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing the
shock-layer concept . the present formulation takes into account the salient
features of the transport processes within the shock layer in a manner
consistent with the shock-layer approximation . the rankine-hugoniot
shock relations are modified to include contributions due to heat
conduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shock .
the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treated .
the flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether
 or not the transport effects are important immediately behind the
shock . in one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold
 across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on the
boundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficient . in the other
regime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but the
continuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution is
obtained . this solution reveals a substantial reduction of the
temperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in the
presence of strong surface cooling .
the present study is intended to provide a knowledge to bridge the gap
between the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via
 the continuum theory . in this respect, the solution obtained appears
to be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limits
for the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate .

investigation of full scale split trailing edge wing
flaps with various chords and hinge locations .
  an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a.
full-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane
equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing
flaps .  the object of the investigation was to determine
and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane
and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap
deflection, and flap location along the wing chord .  the
chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the
wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0
to 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8
percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge .  the
investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution
tests, and downwash surveys .  the results give the lift,
the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the
airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure
distribution over the flaps and wing at one section,
and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing
combinations .
  an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from
the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the
airplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching
moment .  the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with
increase in flap deflection or flap chord .  flap
normal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap
deflection and were relatively independent of flap chord,
hinge-axis location, and airplane attitude .  the location of
the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of
the hinge axis remained practically constant
irrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or
location .  flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a
power of flap chord greater than the square so that with
regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most
efficient in producing a given increase in lift .
  split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the
magnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing
profile .  at low angles of attack the predominant effect
of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface
pressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively
the upper-surface pressures .  downwash surveys
indicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing
chord line would be more effective than those below the
chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of
the airplane with flaps deflected .

pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings with

extensive tables are given of pressure coefficients measured at reynolds
 numbers from 1.3x10 to 3.9x10 on two half-models of identical planform
with 5( rae 101 and 9( rae 101 streamwise sections . the planform of
aspect ratio 3.899 has a straight trailing edge with 60degree of
sweepback, constant chord over most of the span and a parabolic outer portion
of the leading edge curving to a pointed tip . the overall wing
characteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and are
compared with lifting-surface theory .
the low-speed experimental pressure distributions and surface oil-flow
patterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset of
separation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at high
incidence . series of contrasting upper-surface isobars illustrate some
features of the different stalling processes of the two wings . the
direct influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures is
assessed in general terms . a fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow
 is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water and
measurements of high suction near the trailing edge .
studies of the extent of leading-edge stall and location of part-span
vortices, in particular two simultaneous leading-edge vortices on the
thinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures .
after a detailed discussion of the effect of reynolds number and the
distinct types of separated flow, a few results with leading-edge
roughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation and
the extensive influence of part-span roughness .

methods for calculating the lift distribution of wings /subsonic
lifting surface theory/ .
this report contains some fairly simple and economic methods for
calculating the load distribution on wings of any plan form based on
the conceptions of lifting surface theory . the computer work required
is only a small fraction of that of existing methods with comparable
accuracy . this is achieved by a very careful choice of the positions
of pivotal points, by plotting once for all those parts of the downwash
integral which occur frequently and by a consequent application of
approximate integration methods similar to those devised by the author
for lifting line problems .
the basis of the method is to calculate the local lift and pitching
moment at a number of chordwise sections from a set of linear equations
satisfying the downwash conditions at two pivotal points in each
section . interpolation functions of trigonometrical form are used for
spanwise integration both in setting up the downwash equations and in
getting the resultant forces on the wing from the local forces . the
preliminary chordwise integrations for the downwash are predigested in
a series of charts/figs.1-6/,.it is these which make the method a
practical computing proposition .
the theory is outlined in sections 2-5,.section 6 deals with the
solution of the linear equation and section 7 with the resultant forces
on the wing . some examples are worked out in section 8 to compare with
other methods,. one solution is given in full detail in tables 8-30 as a
 guide for computers . appendices i-vi discuss more carefully some
salient points of the mathematical theory, and appendix vii is intended
to instruct the computer how to carry out the steps of the calculation .

  this report contains the results
of pressure measurements on three
and aspect ratio 5, over an
incidence range up to 10 .  chordwise
and spanwise lift distributions
are given, mostly near the centre
where, on two of the wings,
modifications had been made to the section
shape .  it was found that altering
the thickness distribution in the
centre did not affect the loading but
that approximately straight isobars
could be obtained at values of
below about 0.1 .  by the incorporation
of twist and camber in the central
part the distortion of the lift
distribution in the centre could be
avoided at one particular incidence,
and thus the same chordwise
distribution obtained over most of the span .
  twist and camber alone do not improve
the isobar pattern and
therefore a thickness modification would be
needed to give the desired
lift distribution and isobar pattern at one
particular incidence .

of the boundary layer
and of the effect of aspect ratio will be given

generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory .
linearized, compressible-flow analysis is applied to the study of
quasi-conical supersonic wing theory . single-integral equations are
derived which relate either the loading to the shape of a lifting
surface or the thickness of a symmetrical wing to the pressure
distribution for triangular wings with subsonic leading edges . the forms of
these equations and their inversions are simplified through the
introduction of the finite part and the generalized principal part of an
integral .
applications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previously
known results . in the nonlifting case, it is shown that for a specified
 pressure distribution the theory does not always predict a unique
thickness distribution . this is demonstrated for a triangular plan form
 having a constant pressure gradient in the stream direction .

the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow .
a generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation
 relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leading
edges/to the given downwash distribution over the wing . the complete
solution of this integral equation is derived . this complete solution
is composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the other
antisymmetric with respect to the spanwise co-ordinate,. each part
represents a velocity potential . for example, if y is the spanwise
co-ordinate and x is measured in the free stream direction, then a
downwash of the form w-a ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise to a
symmetric potential, whereas w-a ux/y/sgn y is anti-symmetric and gives
rise to an anti-symmetric potential . the velocity potentials of such
flows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to and
including homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwise
co-ordinates . table iii gives similar formulae in the limiting case
were used over a cycle of the tumbling motion . the analytical
expression was in good agreement with numerical solutions of the complete
non-linear equations of motion .

the use of conical camber to produce flow attachment at the leading
edge of a delta wing and to minimize the lift-dependent drag at sonic
and supersonic speeds .
in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thin
delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed
 there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached
flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift
coefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given
in terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding
 to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speeds
load distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and
 the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized
theory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with
 respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load
distributions . it is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these
conically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached
flow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing at
the same mach number, as more terms are included in the linear
combination . however, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable
reduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wing
shapes are calculated and drawn . the optimum shapes for a fixed number
of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so
that the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributed
force on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar
magnitude .

aerodynamic effects of some configuration variables
on the aeroelastic characteristics of lifting surfaces
at mach numbers from 0. 7 to 6. 86 .
  results of flutter tests on
some simple all-movable-control-type
models are given .  one set of models,
which had a square planform with
double-wedge airfoils with four
different values of leading- and
trailing-edge radii from 0 to 6 percent chord
and airfoil thicknesses of 9, 11,
at mach numbers from 0.7 to 6.86 .
the bending-to-torsion frequency
ratio was about 0.33 .  the other set of
models, which had a tapered planform
with single-wedge and double-wedge
airfoils with thicknesses of 3, 6, 9,
and 12 percent chord, was tested
at mach numbers from 0.7 to 3.98 and
a frequency ratio of about 0.42 .
  the tests indicate that, in general,
increasing thickness has a
destabilizing effect at the higher mach
numbers but is stabilizing at
subsonic and transonic mach numbers .
double-wedge airfoils are more
prone to flutter than single-wedge
airfoils at comparable stiffness
levels .  increasing airfoil bluntness
has a stabilizing effect on the
flutter boundary at supersonic speeds
but has a negligible effect at
subsonic speeds .  however, increasing
bluntness may also lead to
divergence at supersonic speeds .
  results of calculations using
second-order piston-theory aerodynamics
in conjunction with a coupled-mode
analysis and an uncoupled-mode analysis
are compared with the experimental
results for the sharp-edge airfoils at
supersonic speeds .  the uncoupled-mode
analysis more accurately predicted
the flutter characteristics of the
tapered-planform models, whereas the
coupled-mode analysis was somewhat
better for the square-planform models .
for both the uncoupled- and coupled-mode
analyses, agreement with the
experimental results improved with
increasing mach number .  in general,
both methods of analysis gave unconservative
results with respect to the
experimental flutter boundaries .

with straight, parallel sides
and beveled leading and trailing edges .
the models were supported by a
cantilevered shaft .
  the double-wedge wings were tested
in helium at a mach number of 7.2 .
an effect of airfoil thickness on flutter
speed was found, thicker wings
requiring more stiffness to avoid flutter .
a few tests in air at a mach
number of 6.9 showed the same thickness
effect and also indicated that
tests in helium would predict conservative
flutter boundaries in air .
the data in air and helium seemed to be
correlated by piston-theory
calculations .  piston-theory calculations
agreed well with experiment for
the thinner models but began to deviate
as the thickness parameter
approached and exceeded 1.0 .
  a few tests on flat-plate models
with various elastic-axis locations
were made .  piston-theory calculations
would not satisfactorily predict
the flutter of these models, probably
because of their blunt leading
edges .

closed-form expressions and tables composed from these expressions are

angles of attack and sideslip in newtonian flow . aerodynamic
coefficients of these bodies are tabulated for various body segments
over a range of angles of attack from 1degree to 85degree and angles of
sideslip from 0degree to 15degree .
some comparisons between newtonian predictions and hypersonic
experimental aerodynamic characteristics were made for conic bodies
having various surface slopes, nose bluntnesses, and body cross sections
 to indicate the range of validity of the theory . in general, the
theory is shown to agree quite well with experimental results for
sharp-nose complete cones and for configurations having large blunted
noses and steep surface slopes . however, agreement between theory and
experiment generally is poor for the more slender, slightly blunted
complete or half conic bodies and also for sharp-nose half conic bodies
where real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces,
 leeward surface contributions, or leading-edge pressure reductions may
have significant effect . the agreement between theory and experiment
for the bodies considered can be improved by using the stagnation
pressure coefficient behind a normal shock rather than 2 as the newtonian
coefficient, although for the sharp-nose half conic bodies there is no
theoretical justification for this modification .

  a program to investigate the aerodynamic heat transfer of a

langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6.8
and a reynolds number from approximately 0.14x10 to
experimental heat-transfer coefficients were slightly less over the

heat-transfer coefficients could be correlated by a single relation
between local stanton number and local reynolds number .
  pitot pressure profiles taken at a mach number of 6.8 on a
hemisphere-cylinder have verified that the local mach number or
velocity outside the boundary layer required in the theories may
be computed from the surface pressures by using isentropic flow
relations and conditions immediately behind a normal shock .
the experimental pressure distribution at a mach number of
velocity gradients calculated at the stagnation point by using
the modified newtonian theory vary with mach number and
are in good agreement with those obtained from measured
pressures for mach numbers from 1.2 to 6.8 .

diameter and conditions behind the normal shock were used,
was in good agreement with the experiment when the velocity

resulted in an incremental lift for all jet locations that was equal to

some experiments relating to the problem of simulation of hot jet
engines in studies of jet effects on adjacent surfaces at a free-stream
mach number of 1.80 .
an investigation at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 in a blowdown type
 tunnel was made to study the effect on the pressure distribution of a
zero angle of attack wing surface when certain exhaust parameters of a
hot turbojet engine are varied . static-pressure surveys were made on a
wing surface that was located in the vicinity of a small-scale
propulsive jet . this propulsive jet was operated with four types of jet
exhausts . these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a
 cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two
 cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/ . the hot jet, because of its
high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was
performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust
parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine . the cold jets
used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the
exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific
heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold
jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet . the tests were made over
 a range of jet-exit staticpressure ratios from 1 to 9 with values of
the ratio of specific heats of 1.27, 1.40, and 1.66 and at variations in
 density and velocity of the order of approximately 8 and 3 times,
respectively .
within the scope of this investigation, it was found that jet-exit
static-pressure ratio and the ratio of specific heats affected the
pressure distribution on the wing associated with jet interference while
 a variation in exit velocity and density did not . the jet-exit
staticpressure ratio affected the wing pressure distribution in a major
way while the ratio of specific heats had only a minor effect . the
addition of temperature in the propulsive jet exhaust at a jet-exit
staticpressure ratio of 4 had little or no effect on the pressure
distribution associated with jet interference on the wing .

pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhausting
in a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to a
free-stream flow of mach number 2.0 .
an investigation at a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10 was made to
determine the pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket
jets exhausting in a spanwise direction beneath the wing and
perpendicular to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0 . the ranges of the
variables involved were /1/ nozzle types - one sonic /jet mach number of
two-dimensional supersonic /jet mach number of 1.71/,. /2/ vertical
nozzle positions beneath the wing of 4, 8, and 12 nozzle-throat
diameters,. and /3/ ratios of rocket-chamber total pressure to
free-stream static pressure from 0 to 130 .
the incremental normal force due to jet interference on the wing varied
from one to two times the rocket thrust and generally decreased as the
pressure ratio increased . the chordwise coordinate of the
incremental-normal-force center of pressure remained upstream of the nozzle center
line for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigation .
 the chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distance
beneath the wing increased . in the spanwise direction there was little
change due to varying rocket-jet position and pressure ratio . some
boundary-layer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocket
jets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratios . the magnitude
 of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jet
interference was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased as
the jet was displaced farther from the wing .
the design procedure for the rockets used is given in the appendix .

effects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets .
this paper is a preliminary and brief account of some research currently
 being conducted to determine the jet effects on adjacent surfaces from
the firing of rocket jets . measurements of jet-effect pressures on a
flat plate as well as shadowgraphs are presented that were obtained when
 a rocket jet at a mach number of 3 was exhausted downstream and
upstream into free-stream flow at a mach number of 2 located from 2 to 4.7
 rocket-jet-exit diameters from the plate . the jet effects on the flat
plate with the rocket jet exhausting downstream are of the same order of
 magnitude as those previously obtained from sonic exits with a total
pressure 10 times lower . a maximum pressure coefficient on the plate of
rocket-jet-exit diameters below the plate, and an integration of the
measured jet-effect pressures at this position resulted in a normal
force on the plate equal to 2.3 times the thrust output of the rocket
jet .

the unsteady lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio .
unsteady-lift functions for wings of finite aspect ratio have been
calculated by correcting the aerodynamic inertia and the angle of attack of
 the infinite wing . the calculations are based on the operational
method .
the starting lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly less
than that of the infinite wing,. whereas the final lift may be
considerably less . the theory indicates that the initial distribution of
lift is similar to the final distribution .
curves showing the variation of lift after a sudden unit change in angle
 of attack, during penetration of a sharpedge gust, and during a
continuous oscillation are given . operational equivalents of these
functions have been devised to facilitate the calculation of lift under
various conditions of motion . as an application of these formulas, the
vertical acceleration of a loaded wing caused by penetrating a gust has
been calculated .

approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span in
incompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients .
the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change in
sinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratios
of 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspect
ratios of 0, 3, and 6 . for the elliptical and rectangular wings the
spanwise lift distributions were also presented . these functions were
calculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating
 harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from several
sources .
the results of these calculations indicate that the normalized
unsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape of
the plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,.
 however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-state
value is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of the
same aspect ratio . these results also corroborate the results of other
investigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with
 a decrease in aspect ratio . the shape of the spanwise distributions of
 the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independent
of time for rectangular and elliptical wings .

two and three-dimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight .
the problem of transient lift on two- and three-dimensional wings flying

analysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of
 sources and doublets . the applications include the evaluation of
indicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for two-dimensional sinking and
pitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and

numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking

numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking
airfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with
 calculations for mach number 0.7 .
the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatory
indicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have been
modified to include the noncirculatory lift associated with
apparent-mass effects . although the apparent-mass effects are impulsive in
nature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects in
compressible flow is a time-dependent function . the corresponding
reciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are given . by use
of the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and
 moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencing a sudden acquisition
of vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7 .
lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation of
these functions at other mach numbers .
although the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration of a
sharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileron
coefficients by a similar analysis, sufficient coefficients are not
available at the present . however, an approximate method is shown for
determining a portion of this unsteady-lift function .
when a comparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbers
appears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for the
incompressible case . consequently, the calculation of the gust load factor
at high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensional
incompressible indicial lift functions and an over-all correction for
compressibility such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative .

the indicial lift and moment functions are determined approximately for
sinking and pitching motion at mach numbers m of 0.5 and 0.6 . these
functions are determined from a knowledge of the existing oscillatory
coefficients at the low reduced frequencies and from approximate
expressions of these coefficients at the high reduced frequencies .
the beginning portion of the indicial lift function associated with an

use of an exact method . by use of an approximate method for determining
 the remaining portion, the complete indicial gust function is
determined for m 0.5, m 0.6, and m 0.7 .
all the indicial lift and moment functions are approximated by an

a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamic
forces on oscillating or steady finite wings at subsonic speeds .
a detailed description is given of a method of approximating solutions
to the integral equation that relates oscillatory or steady lift and
downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow . the method of
solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or
straight leading and trailing edges . moreover, it is directly
applicable to control surfaces such as all-movable tails but modifications
are needed to apply it to controls in general . applications of the
method involve evaluations of numerous integrals that must be handled by
 numerical procedures but systematic schemes of evaluations have been
adopted that are well suited to the routines of automatic digital
computing machines . these schemes of evaluation have been incorporated in
a program for an ibm 704 electronic data processing machine . with this
machine, a pressure distribution together with such quantities as
section or total lift and moment coefficients or generalized forces can be
determined for a given value of frequency and mach number and for
several /four or five/ modes of oscillation in about 4 minutes of
machine time . in the case of steady downwash conditions corresponding
quantities can be obtained in about 2 minutes of machine time .
in order to illustrate applications of the method, results of several
calculations are presented . in these illustrations total forces and
moments are compared /1/ with results of analytic procedures for a
circular plan form with steady downwash conditions, /2/ with results of
other theories and with experiment for a rectangular plan form of aspect
 ratio 1 at a uniform angle of attack, and /3/ with some experimental
results for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 2 undergoing
pitching and flapping oscillations . also included in the illustrations are
results of flutter calculations compared with experimental results for
an allmovable control surface of aspect ratio 3.50 and for a
cantilevered rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 5.04 .

on the kernel function of the integral equation relating the lift and

this report treats the kernel function of an integral equation that
relates a known or prescribed downwash distribution to an unknown lift
distribution for a harmonically oscillating finite wing in compressible
subsonic flow . the kernel function is reduced to a form that can be
accurately evaluated by separating the kernel function into two parts ..
 a part in which the singularities are isolated and analytically
expressed and a nonsingular part which may be tabulated . the form of the
kernel function for the sonic case /mach number of 1/ is treated
separately . in addition, results for the special cases of mach number
of o /incompressible case/ and frequency of o /steady case/ are given .
the derivation of the integral equation which involves this kernel
function, originally performed elsewhere /see, for example, naca
technical memorandum 979/, is reproduced as an appendix . another appendix
gives the reduction of the form of the kernel function obtained herein
for the three-dimensional case to a known result of possio for
two-dimensional flow . a third appendix contains some remarks on the
evaluation of the kernel function, and a fourth appendix presents an

thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining
nose shapes at hypersonic speeds .
the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to
severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g.,
internal convection, transpiration, or radiation . it is this latter
mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper .
neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for
long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point
of refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient
 away from the leading edge . inclusion of conduction in the aft
direction reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to a
location that will radiate it out from the surface . for either
steady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is
reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge
shoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balance
between the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by
conduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface . the feasibility of
 such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge
shapes and materials . the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge
shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as
shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown .

the smallest height of roughness capable of affecting boundary-layer
transition .
an investigation was made to determine the smallest size of isolated
roughness that will affect transition in a laminar-boundary layer .
critical heights for three types of roughness were found in a low-speed
wind tunnel . the types were /1/ two-dimensional spanwise wires, /2/
three-dimensional discs, and /3/ a sandpaper type . in addition to type
of roughness, test variables included the location of roughness,
pressure distribution, degree of tunnel turbulence, and length of natural
laminar flow .
the most satisfactory correlation parameter was found to be the
roughness reynolds number, based on the height of roughness and flow
properties at this height . the value of this critical reynolds number was
found to be substantially independent of all test variables except the
shape of roughness . this parameter also correlates well other published
 data on critical roughness in low-speed flow . the value of the
roughness reynolds number necessary to move transition forward to the
roughness itself was also determined for the three types of roughness and was
 found to be approximately constant for a given type of roughness .
an investigation of the limited amount of available data on critical
roughness in supersonic flow indicates that the effects of roughness may
 still be correlated by the roughness reynolds number . the value of
this reynolds number depends primarily on the mach number at the top of
the roughness . when this mach number is greater than 1.0, the roughness
 reynolds number based on conditions behind a shock is probably the
characteristic parameter .

low-speed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a

contour .
an investigation has been conducted at various reynolds numbers and low
subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic
characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect-ratio wings having
variations in leading-edge contours . the planforms included a highly swept
triangular wing, a rectangular wing, and intermediate wings including
planforms having elliptic and parabolic leading-edge contours, all
having an aspect ratio of 1.33 . the effects of changing aspect ratio for a
 given leading-edge contour were investigated for two of the wings
presented,. also included are the longitudinal characteristics associated
with various fuselage sizes . an effort has been made to estimate the
lift variation with angle of attack for the wing planforms of the
present investigation .
improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds
associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible
by slight alterations in leading-edge design, which should still conform
 to possible design requirements at hypersonic speeds . these changes in
 planform resulted in increases in lift-curve slope, lift at high angles
 of attack, and in the maximum untrimmed lift-drag ratio, provided the
fuselage was sufficiently small . the longitudinal stability
characteristics of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability
characteristics at high lifts than either a triangular wing or
rectangular wing of the same aspect ratio . the effects of increasing
reynolds number for each of the planforms investigated generally resulted
in slight reductions in the lift at high angles of attack . a method is
presented for estimating the subsonic-lift variation with angle of
attack for the low-aspect-ratio wings of the present investigation and
indicated good agreement with experimental data throughout the
angle-of-attack range of this investigation .

motions of a short 10degree blunted cone entering a martian atmosphere
at arbitrary angles of attack and arbitrary pitching rates .
the dynamic behavior of two probe vehicles entering a martian atmosphere
 in a passive manner with arbitrary initial angles of attack and
pitching rates to 12degree per second has been determined . results for an
entry velocity of 21,700 feet per second and an entry angle of -40degree
 were obtained from machine calculated solutions of the six-degree-
of-freedom rigid-body equations of motion using experimental aerodynamic
characteristics for the vehicles . one of the vehicles had a flat base
and was statically stable in two attitudes /nose forward and base
forward/ . the other vehicle, derived from the first by adding a conical
afterbody, was statically stable in only one attitude /nose forward/ .
a 10-rpm vehicle spin rate, believed ample for the purpose of
distributing solar and aerodynamic heating over the vehicle surface, and
 model atmospheres encompassing the probable extremes for the planet
were also considered .
it was found that while the motion of the flat-based vehicle could be
oscillatory about either the nose-forward or base-forward stable trim
attitudes when aerodynamic heating rates were high, the range of initial
 angles of attack resulting in base-forward orientation was reduced by
more than a factor of 3. when initial pitch rates were increased from
body having only nose-forward stability showed that oscillatory angles
of attack at maximum heating-rate conditions probably would not exceed
about 25degrees although angles of attack when heating rates were 50
percent of maximum could be as high as 40degree . values of these upper
bound angles of attack were essentially independent of initial pitch
rates for the range considered . furthermore, the envelope of maximum
probable angles of attack was increased only slightly when the vehicle
was given a 10-rpm spin rate . the relationship between maximum
amplitudes of oscillation and heating rates through high heating portions of
the trajectories was preserved when model atmospheres believed to
encompass the extreme possibilities for mars were used in the calculations

it embraces and extends aeronautics, and i would like to propose
including both, at least on certain occasions, under a general
denomination of /aerocosmonautics/ .
in your country, the sciences and technology of space are subjects which
have been backed by initial advances and abundantly treated .
since france has not yet launched any artificial satellite or built
any circumlunar space vehicle, i propose to confine myself here to the
field of aeronautics, where there is still so much progress of manifest
utility to accomplish .
i shall accordingly content myself with presenting some examples of
aeronautical research and experiments undertaken in my country by
onera, a body whose mission is akin to that of the illustrious naca,
now nasa, but bearing in mind the considerable difference between the
scales of the respective resources .

tumbling bodies entering the atmosphere .
the equations of motion of a tumbling flat plate entering an exponential
 atmosphere were linearized and solved analytically to obtain a simple
expression for the altitude at which tumbling would cease and libration
would commence . the plate had only three degrees of freedom, and
aerodynamic forces were derived from newtonian impact theory . in the
linear analysis, mean values of the drag and pitch damping coefficients
so that flutter occurs in the range of a low-speed wind tunnel .
a particular type of construction for supersonic flutter models is
described in detail . methods of vibration testing, static testing, and
flutter testing are discussed . particular emphasis is placed on the
technique of varying flow parameters rather than model parameters to
precipitate flutter . the tool for varying flow parameters is the
variable mach number supersonic test section of the massachusetts
institute of technology blowdown wind tunnel . the aerodynamic features of
 the supersonic test section are presented .

a note on the use of sandwich structures in severe acoustic
environments .
this paper reviews some of the experience to date of using sandwich type
structures in severe acoustic pressure environments .  the methods
used for testing sandwich structures for acoustic fatigue are described
and their limitations considered .  experimental and theoretical work
relating to the damping and mode-frequency relationships of certain
sandwich configurations is also reviewed .
special attention is given to the estimation of the stress in the bond
of a honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to sudden pressure
fluctuations .  a /uni-modal/ theory is presented, relating the
mean-square bond-stress to the random exciting pressure and panel dynamic
characteristics .  this theory indicates that tensile bond stresses
may be encountered of up to six times the local r.m.s. exciting
pressure .  these must be combined with bending and shear stresses
to obtain the principal stresses which precipitate bond fatigue
failures .
finally, an outline is given of some of the lines of future research
which should lead to the achieving of the maximum possible fatigue
resistance from sandwich configurations .

near noise field of a jet engine exhaust .
  aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet
engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that
may cause structural fatigue .  studies of such structures have
been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved .
  the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary
turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for
a single operating condition without afterburning .  the
maximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found
to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in
the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit .
with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased
by 50 percent .  the largest sound pressures without
afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in
the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps .
  additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect
of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine
the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid
surfaces and corresponding free-field values .  near the jet
nozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low
power (approx. unity) of the jet velocity .  over-all sound-pressure
levels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field
levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along
the jet boundary .
  the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure
at any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary
and the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same
frequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from
the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on
a dimensionless basis .  also, the strouhal number of the
corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at
similar distances downstream .
  in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of
the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross
correlation of the pressure over the surface area .  cross-correlation
measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet
velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the
jet .  free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and
of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps
were obtained both longitudinally and laterally .  in addition,
correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the
surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the
distance over which a positive correlation existed .
  the region of positive correlation was generally found to
increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5
nozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter .  in
general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a
function of jet velocity or frequency-band width .  the distance
from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for
lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same
conditions and locations .  the correlation curves obtained in free
space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar .
  the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on
surfaces .

random excitation of a tailplane section by jet noise .
  the response of a section of tailplane structure to both discrete
and random noise pressures has been studied in detail .  initially the
specimen was mounted behind a jet engine and the induced strains were
analysed with the object of determining both the resonant frequencies
and the corresponding modes of vibration .  during these tests a survey
was made of the spectrum and correlation pattern of the jet noise on
the surface of the model .  secondly the specimen was mounted in front
of a loudspeaker in an acoustics laboratory and the structural
resonances were excited by means of discrete frequency sound .  the mode
shapes were studied in detail with the aid of a stroboscope .
  it is concluded that the tailplane skin on this particular piece
of structure only responds to any significant degree in one structural
mode .  although reasonable comparison has been obtained between the
random and discrete tests, it was not possible to calculate the induced
stresses using the observed mode shapes and measured pressure
excitation .

on the fatigue failure of structures due to vibrations excited
by random pressure fields .
on the assumption that the forced modes of vibration of a structure,
subjected to pressure fluctuations random in time and space, can be
approximated by the composition of the motions of the uncoupled
natural modes, a general analysis is made using the ideas of vibration
theory and spectrum analysis .  the power spectrum, and hence the
rms value, of any quantity depending linearly upon structural
distortions is derived and it involves a quantity (called the /joint
acceptance/) concerning the spacewise structure of the pressure
field and of the geometry of the modes of vibration .  it is shown how
this result may be used (on assuming /normal/ randomness) to estimate
the fatigue life on the hypothesis of cumulative damage .

structural acoustic proof testing .
with the introduction of high-powered
propulsion systems, and paralleling their
continued development, an
accompanying increase in acoustical problems has arisen .
  of these acoustical problems, that of
acoustical fatigue failures has become paramount
in the eyes of the structural engineer .  aircraft
designed to normal strength requirements have
been known literally to fall apart under acoustical
loading .  this problem has required much
endeavour to produce a solution, and considerable
structural research, based upon results of siren or
other testing, have proved inadequate .  this
failure to find a satisfactory solution has resulted
in the conviction that the final proof of a design
can be found only in proof testing .  proof testing,
in the acoustic fatigue sense, is the testing of a
design structure in a simulated acoustical
environment for a period of time long enough to assure
equality with design life .

  experience has shown that the fluctuating loads induced by a

in order to throw some light on this and similar problems, the
stress spectrum and the /equivalent fatigue stress/ of an elastic
structure subjected to random loading are studied .  the analysis
is simplified by assuming the structure to have only a single
degree of freedom and by using the concept of cumulative damage,

discrete-frequency noise from a siren and
random noise from an air jet .  noise
levels varied from approximately
panel variables included thickness,
edge conditions, curvature, and
static-pressure differential .
  no significant differences were noted
in the nature of failures
experienced for the two types of loadings .
at a given root-mean-square
stress level, the failure times were
generally shorter for the random
loading than for the discrete-frequency
loading .  these differences in
failure times were noted to be a function
of stress level, the larger
differences occurring at the lower stress levels .
  increases in time to failure were
obtained as a result of increased
panel thickness, increased panel curvature,
and particularly for increased
static-pressure differential across curved panels .
  for the discrete-type loading,
the location of weak points in these
simplified structural designs can be
satisfactorily accomplished but
quantitative predictions of fatigue

stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading .
theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels for
continuous skin-stiffener panels subjected to a random pressure field
are considered in the light of powell's general theory for statistical
superposition of modal response . the choice of structural model is
dictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modern
flight vehicle design . the present study clearly demonstrates that any
truly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures
 requires a much better representation of structural characteristics
than can be provided by single panel idealizations . in an example
considering fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essential
agreement is shown with experimental data, although better correlation is
shown for rms stress than for power spectrum . it is shown that
reduction of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in the
higher frequency range .

on the bending of a clamped plate .
  the present paper contains an application
of a recently developed variational
method to the boundary value problem of the
bending of a clamped plate of
arbitrary shape .  it will be shown that this problem
can be linked to the simpler problem
of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain
of intermediate problems, which can be
solved explicitly and in finite form in terms
of the membrane problem .  in the
intermediate problems, the deflection converges
uniformly in the domain of the plate
of the clamped plate, and the derivatives
of all orders of the deflection converge
uniformly in every domain completely interior
to the plate .  (in the ritz method, not even
the convergence of the slopes can be
guaranteed .)  the method yields numerical
results for plates of all shapes for which
the membrane problem (which we shall call
the base problem) admits an explicit
solution .  as an example we shall consider a
clamped square plate under a uniform load .
this problem has been the object of
numerous investigations, some of which are
theoretical, while others are purely numerical,
use infinite simple and double series,
and operate with an infinite number of
linear equations and an infinite number of
unknowns .  an inspection of the general
formulae derived in the present paper,
formulae which become simple in numerical
applications, would show how some of the
numerical methods might be rendered
rigorous .  the convergence of higher
derivatives is of great practical interest for
the approximate computation of the stresses .

on the analogues relating flexure and extension of
flat plates .
  the displacement of a flat plate bent
by transverse loading, and the extensional
or in 'plane stress', are governed by equations
of identical form ,. and the boundary
conditions have identical form when
edge-displacements are specified in the flexural,
edge-tractions in the extensional problem,
so mathematically, in these circumstances,
only a single problem is presented .  this,
the 'first analogue' relating flexure and
extension, is well known .
  a 'second analogue', relating the flexural
problem when edge-tractions with the
extensional problem when edge-displacements
are specified, is believed to have been
first propounded in 1941 .  by introducing
two quantities u and v, analogous with
the components u and v of extensional
displacement, it permits a treatment of the
flexural problem by any method--e.g.
which yields extensional solutions of this
second type .
  in this paper both analogues are combined
in an inclusive statement covering the
perforated (multiply connected) plates which
were discussed in 1948 .  reasons are
stated for believing that 'two-diagram technique'
is preferable in problems governed
by 'mixed' boundary conditions .

similar problems, i.e., those of the clamped rectangular
plate under uniform pressure, under a central
concentrated load, and that of the simply supported sector of a
disk under uniform pressure, have been discussed by
previous authors .  the general approach used in the
foregoing problems is adopted in the present case ,. a
considerable reduction in the computational work is achieved,
however, by the use of an integral-equation method of
solving the boundary-condition equations .  numerical
results are obtained for plates of various dimensions, and
the edge moment distributions are plotted for these cases .
curves are also plotted which indicate the relationship
existing between the maximum bending moments derived
for sectorial plates and those previously obtained for

.W
the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

the behaviour of a cylindrical shell under axial compression
when the buckling load has been exceeded .
  the value of the compressive stress at which
a thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has been
worked out theoretically by southwell (1914) .  subsequent
experimental results, however, have indicated that this
value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion
which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .
  in recent years much work has been done on this problem
in america .  lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)
have concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatly
influenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and
tsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can be
maintained in a buckled state by a compressive load
considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .
  the present paper is an extension of the work of von karman
and tsien .  it shows that the smallest load which will
keep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third
of that given by southwell, a result in very fair
agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,
and so long as the stresses remain within the elastic
range of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its
original stiffness .

in the present paper a short survey will be given first of the buckling
and postbuckling behavior of isotropic cylindrical shells subjected
to different loading conditions as obtained by the nonlinear theory
of finite deflections of shells during the last twenty years .
next a report will be given on new investigations carried out in the
structures department of the dvl concerning the elastic stability of
isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells loaded in axial compression
and internal pressure .  these studies are based on the nonlinear theory
of finite deformations .  the theoretical rsults will be compared with
new experimental results obtained with a series of axially loaded

lower buckling load in the non-linear buckling theory
of thin shells .
  for thin shells the relation between
the load p and the deflection beyond the
classical buckling load is very often
non-linear .  for instance, when a uniform thin
circular cylinder is loaded in the axial
direction, the load p when plotted against the
end-shortening has the characteristic
shown in fig. 1 .  if the strain energy s and the
total potential are calculated,
their behavior can be represented by the
curves shown in figs. 2 and 3 .  it can be
demonstrated that the branches oc and ab
corresponds to stable equilibrium configurations
and the branch bc to unstable
equilibrium configurations .  the point b is then
the point of transition from stable to
unstable equilibrium configurations .

aeroelastic problems in connection with high speed
flight .
  a review is given of developments
in the field of aeroelasticity during the
past ten years .  the effect of steadily increasing
mach number has been two-fold ..  on
the one hand the aerodynamic derivatives have
changed, and in some cases brought new
problems, and on the other hand the design for
higher mach numbers has led to thinner
aerofoils and more slender fuselages for which
the required stiffness is more difficult to
provide .  both these aspects are discussed,
and various methods of attack on the
problems are considered .  the relative merits
of stiffness, damping and massbalance
for the prevention of control surface flutter are
discussed .  a brief mention is made of
the recent problems of damage from jet efflux
and of the possible aeroelastic effects
of kinetic heating .

bodt freedom flutter of ground launched rocket models
at supersonic and high subsonic speeds .
  a theoretical investigation of symmetric
body freedom flutter of a rocket model is described .  the results
confirm that structural failures of models were caused
by this type of flutter, and an extension of the investigation
indicates the parameters that are of importance .  a high
ratio of body to wing mass and a well forward position of the
overall centre of gravity are conditions under which flutter
may occur .  increase of body pitching radius of gyration
and tailplane volume are beneficial .
  it is concluded that this type of flutter may be significant
in some aircraft designs, and that the canard has no
advantage in this respect over the conventional lay-out of wing
and tailplane .

the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and sweepback
on wing flutter .
  the report describes tests to obtain direct
measurements of the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on wing flutter .  the tests were made on rigid
wings with root flexibilities .
  it is shown that measured effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on the flutter of these wings can be represented
quite closely in flutter calculations based on two-dimensional
flow theory by multiplying the two-dimensional
aerodynamic coefficients by appropriate factors .  the effect of
sweepback is represented by multiplying all aerodynamic
coefficients by cos, where is the wing leading-edge
sweepback, and the effect of aspect ratio is represented by
multiplying the aerodynamic damping coefficients by 1f(a) and,
the stiffness coefficients by 1(f(a)) where a is the
aspect ratio .
  for the wings tested an average value for
f(a) is f(a) = (1 + (0.8a)) .

slender not-so-thin wing theory .
  a method for making an approximate thickness correction to slender
thin-wing theory is presented .  the method is tested by applying it to
cones with rhombic cross-sections and the agreement is found to be good
if the cones are not too thick .  it is then suggested that the
thickness correction to slender thin-wing theory may be applied
unchanged to linear thin-wing theory .  this suggestion is compared with
some experiments on delta wings and it is found that there is
considerable improvement over thin-wing theory near the centre line, but that
this improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached .

development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter and
correlation with kernel-function results .
  the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or
theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased
understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,
acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions .
circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is
included in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiring
the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation
are specified .
  a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the
approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter
is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .
  closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics
of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics .
application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of
three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .
  a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range
from zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and
kernel-function results are compared subsonically .  quasi-steady
results are utilized supersonically .
  primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the
areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies,
modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force
compatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation
of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by
steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete
unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .

heat transfer through laminar boundary layers on

  this paper shows how to calculate the rate of heat transfer
through a laminar boundary layer on a semi-infinite cylinder of
arbitrary cross section .  the cylinder is placed in a stream of
incompressible fluid, the flow at infinity being parallel to the
generators, and is maintained at a uniform temperature .  a
series solution for small downstream distances and an asymptotic
formula for large downstream distances are given .  to cover
the intermediate range an approximate pohlhausen solution is
obtained,. a correction of the error involved in the pohlhausen
solution is suggested which, it is believed, will lead to final errors
of at most 2 percent .  the calculations are applied to elliptic
cylinders, and illustrate the effect on the local rate of heat transfer
of varying the ratio of the major and minor axes of cross section,
the length of perimeter being held fixed .

further comments on the inversion of large structural matrices .
in a recent note, klein referred to a paper co-authored by the writer,
and to ref. 3 .  regarding the subject of inversion of large-order
matrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not as
hopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate' .
the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/s
conclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that the
authors of ref. 2 were pessimistic with respect to large-matrix
inversions .  two general methods of analysis were treated..  the
method of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matrices .
the first method leads directly to a relatively large matrix of
structural coefficients of both internal forces and displacements .
this matrix must be inverted to solve the problem .  the second method
ultimately produces a relatively small matrix requiring inversion.,
however, to arrive at this point one must perform a number of matrix
multiplications .

an investigation of the flow about a plane half-wing
of cropped delta planform and 6( symmetrical section
at stream mach numbers between 0. 8 and 1. 41 .
  a study has been made of the flow development
over the wing as the incidence and stream
mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure
distributions and oil-flow patterns .  the growth
and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and
forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for
flow separation through these shocks are considered .  for
the rear shock, which has little sweep, these
conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation
on two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward
shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems
to correspond to two rather different but
simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the
component mach number normal to the shock front
and the other to the position of the reattachment line .
  the flow in the region between the leading edge and
the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics
analogous to those found upstream of the shock on
two-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward
shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low
supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about
a simple cone .
  the general flow development is related in the
text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag .
the first two are most affected by the aft movement
of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic
drag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be
influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation
and possibly also by some stage in the development
of the forward shock .
  the flow over the cropped-delta planform is
noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock
and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and
partly to the unswept trailing edge .  a comparison is made
with results obtained during preliminary tests in
which the wing planform closely resembled that of a true
delta .

  from a study of existing sonic-boom
theory it has been possible to establish
an approximate lower bound of attainable
sonic-boom overpressure, which depends
only on the airplane length, weight, and
volume and on the flight conditions .
this lower bound may be approached over
a narrow range of flight conditions
through the application of appropriate
design considerations .  in general, for
intermediate values of lift coefficient
the major portion of the lift generating
surfaces must be located aft of the
maximum cross-sectional area, whereas for
higher values of lift coefficient
the maximum area must be well forward and or
the lift-producing surfaces must extend well toward the airplane nose .

  an analytical and experimental study is made for inelastic
instability of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject to

imperfections on the buckling modes and the critical buckling
stresses .  the deformation theory and the incremental theory

experimental results of ten tests on specimens made of aluminum
alloy 3003-0 are presented .  comparison of experimental with
theoretical results indicates that the application of the
deformation theory provides a fairly accurate prediction of buckling
strength, but fails in this case to yield a correct description of
post-buckling behavior .  on the other hand, the application of
the incremental theory, which is mathematically and physically
more rigorous, leads to an overestimation of buckling strength,
even though initial imperfections are considered .  this paradox
has existed for years, and remains to be resolved .

frequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreement
with those predicted by reissner's shallow-shell vibration theory
with the inclusion of an apparent-mass term for the liquid .  the
effect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significant
only for the partially full shell .  in this case the circumferential
node lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of the
shell .
  excitation of low-frequency liquid-sloshing motion by
high-frequency forced oscillation of a partially filled shell occurred in
many cases .  this low-frequency liquid response is tentatively
explained as being excited by a beat frequency in the forced
oscillation .  a similar type of response has been reported by

  the principle of the minimum of the total potential is
employed to obtain stresses and displacements for clamped, short,

shell theory, in which buckling effects are not considered, was
used .  a fourier series is assumed for the deflections in the
closed circumferential direction so that the partial differential
equations of equilibrium are replaced by a set of ordinary
differential equations .  the energy solution is compared with a
simplified approximation which can be considered an equivalent circular
cylinder solution .  graphs of the significant stresses and
displacements are presented for oval cylinders having major to minor
axis ratios of 1.10, 1.30, and 1.50 .  it is shown that the maximum
stresses and displacements increase significantly as the major to

were tested at a mach number of 3.0,
at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 to
stagnation temperatures from 300 f to
effects of thermal stress and buckling on the
flutter of such panels .  the panel
supporting structure allowed partial thermal
expansion of the skins in both the
longitudinal and lateral directions .  panel
skin material and skin thickness were varied .
  a boundary faired through the
experimental flutter points consisted of a
flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel
portion, and a transition point, at the
intersection of the two boundaries,
where a panel is most susceptible to flutter .
the flutter region consisted of two
fairly distinct sections, a large-amplitude
flutter region and a small-amplitude
flutter region .  the results show that an
increase in panel skin temperature
flutter .  the flutter trend for buckled
panels is reversed .  use of a modified
temperature parameter, which approximately
accounts for the effects of differential
pressure and variations in panel skin
material and skin thickness, reduced the
scatter in the data which resulted when
these effects were neglected .  the results
are compared with an exact theory for
clamped panels for the condition of zero

mathematical techniques applying to the thermal fatigue behaviour
of high temperature alloys .
during thermal fatigue testing
of a specimen with a thin edge, or
during rapid temperature changes in the gas
flow past turbine blades, the thin
edges are deformed plastically in compression
during heating and subsequently
creep in tension as the bulk of the specimen
or blade heats up . the plastic
deformation is determined from temperature
distributions, which are calculated
by biot's variational method . the creep
deformation is determined as a function
of time by a differential equation, which
expresses the balance between increasing
elastic stress and reduction of stress due
to creep relaxation, and which is solved
to a riccati equation soluble in
terms of bessel functions, or (iii) by transformation
to a second-order differential
equation with a periodic coefficient .
using the thermal stresses obtained from
the solution of the differential equation, the theoretical thermal
fatigue endurance
is determined from cyclic (mechanical) stress
endurance data . agreement between
theoretical and experimental thermal fatigue
endurances is obtained, over ranges
of temperature, strain, and strain rate, or equivalently, over ranges
of temperature-edge radius and heat transfer coefficient .
this agreement supports the use of
the theoretical methods in wider contexts .
the accuracy of the temperature
distributions is better than the accuracy of
other factors entering into the correlation
between theoretical and experimental endurances .
improvement in the
interpretation of experimental results requires
consideration of the alteration
of the stress  cycles during the course of thermal
fatigue testing . this requirement
is catered for partially by the various solutions of the differential
equation for thermal stress .

formulae for use with the fatigue load meter in the
assessment of wing fatigue life .
  this note gives a method for the derivation of suitable constants
which, when multiplied by the readings recorded at each appropriate
acceleration level on a fatigue load meter and then added together, give
directly the proportion of fatigue life used up in the wing .  it is
suggested that when the estimated proportion is of order 80, then a more
detailed assessment of fatigue life should be made .

hoop stresses which vary in the axial
direction is examined .  for
extremely localised compressive hoop stress
distributions resulting from
thermal discontinuity effects, or from a
uniform, radial line loading,
the buckle pattern should also be

  the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere fixed

approximation by means of the janzen-rayleigh method .
the velocity and the pressure distributions over the
surface of the sphere are computed and the terms involving
the fourth power of the mach number, neglected in rayleigh's
calculation, are shown to be of considerable importance as
the local velocity of sound is approached on the sphere .
the critical mach number, that is, the value of the mach

cooling and flow separation control in a supersonic
nozzle .
  control of flow separation by fluid injection at one diverging
boundary of a two-dimensional, transparent-walled de laval
nozzle was investigated by spark schlieren photography of dry
nitrogen flows expanded from two stagnation temperatures
injection conditions at the permeable boundary were varied by
the use of three grades of porous stainless steel with nominal pore
diameters of 10, 20, and 30 microns, through which nitrogen was
forced by coolant reservoir pressures of 25, 50, and 100 psig, in
addition to the case of no forced injection .  pressure
distribution measurements were made along the nonpermeable diverging
boundary .  it was found that flow separation at expansion ratios
approaching the optimum value for maximum thrust coefficient
could be induced at the porous wall by a local injection mass
velocity of the order of a few per cent of the local main-stream
mass velocity .  separation at the solid boundary was not
noticeably influenced by injection at the opposite wall, and the
asymmetrical separation thus effected jet deflections of up to 10
degrees at the lower stagnation-pressure levels .  variation of the
wall heat-transfer condition by changing the stagnation
temperature did not significantly influence separation behavior .
temperature measurements at the reservoir face of the porous
section, together with use of published correlations and of the
rube-sin analysis for estimation of stream-side stanton numbers under
noninjection and injection conditions, respectively, permitted
heat-transfer calculations which indicated that the effectiveness
of the transpiration technique in controlling nozzle wall
temperatures derives primarily from intimate fluid-solid contact in a
porous material of high specific surface .

use of subsonic kernel function in an influence-coefficient method of
aeroelastic analysis and some comparisons with experiment .
this paper illustrates the development and application of an
influence-coefficient method of analysis for calculating the response
of a flexible wing in an airstream to an oscillating disturbing force
and for treating such aeroelastic instabilities as flutter and
divergence .  aerodynamic coefficients are derived on the basis of
lifting-surface theory for subsonic compressible flow by use of the method
presented in nasa technical report r-48 .
application of the analysis is made to a uniform cantilever
wing-tip tank configuration for which responses to a sinusoidal disturbing
force and flutter speeds were measured over a range of subsonic mach
numbers and densities .  calculated responses and flutter speeds based
on flexibility influence coefficients measured at nine stations are in
good agreement with experiment, provided the aerodynamic load is
distributed over the wing so that local centers of pressure very nearly
coincide with these nine influence stations .  the use of experimental
values of bending and torsional structural damping coefficients in the
analysis generally improved the agreement between calculated and
experimental responses .  some calculations were made to study the
effects of density on responses near the flutter conditions, and linear
response trends were obtained over a wide range of densities .

the effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaces
having their quarter-chord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees . the

heat transfer through the laminar boundary layer on

  this paper presents a method of calculating
the distribution of rate of heat transfer
into a laminar incompressible boundary layer
from the exterior surface of a long thin
circular cylinder, when the surface of the
cylinder is maintained at a constant
temperature and the flow is parallel to the
cylinder axis,. the temperature difference
between the surface and the main stream
is taken to be small enough to neglect
buoyancy effects .  a series solution, valid
for small downstream distances from the
nose, has been obtained already by seban,
bond, and kelly .  this is now extended
by deriving an asymptotic series solution,
valid at large downstream distances, and
bridging the gap between these two series
solutions by an approximate solution,
based on the method used recently by davies
and bourne to calculate heat transfer
from a flat plate .  the calculation is used to
demonstrate the effect of curvature
and of prandtl number on the local rate of heat
transfer at various downstream
distances by comparing with the corresponding flat plate results .

the frictional force on a cylinder moving steadily parallel to its
length through a viscous liquid which is initially at rest is determined
 with reasonable accuracy over the whole range of values of the duration
 of the motion and for a wide variety of shapes of the cylinder
cross-section . when the time t is small, the first approximation gives a
force per unit area which is the same as that for a flat plate of
infinite width . the second approximation takes the shape of the cylinder
into account and the force on unit length of cylinder is determined in
terms of the number of corners, and their angles, in the cylinder cross
linder is the same, to this approximation, as that on a circular
cylinder of the same perimeter . for large values of t the determination of
the frictional force is reducible to that of a potential problem, the
solution of which is known for a number of different shapes . the
approximations for small and large values of t for any one cylinder do
not overlap but can be joined without much ambiguity . for no value of t
 do the forces on cylinders of different shape /excluding those whose
curvature is not everywhere inwards/ differ by more than about 25 per

greater than 1/2, the method yields the expected square root growth of

.W
a wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotary
stability derivatives at subsonic and supersonic speeds .
a method is described for measuring the dynamic stability derivatives
of a model airplane in a wind tunnel .  the characteristic features
of this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations were
used to obtain combinations of rolling, yawing and pitching motions.,
that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedback
which permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for more
conventional types of oscillatory testing., and that data processing was
greatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gage
circuitry .
the system described is primarily for measurement of the damping
derivatives damping
in roll damping in pitch, damping in yaw, and the cross derivatives
rolling moment due to yawing and yawing moment due to rolling .  the
method of testing also permits measurement under oscillatory conditions
of the static derivatives rolling moment due to sideslip, yawing moment
due to sideslip, and pitching moment due to angle of attack .  all these
derivatives are of particular importance in estimating the short-period
oscillatory motions of a rigid airplane .
a small number of experimental data are included to illustrate the
general scope of results obtainable with this system .

some low speed problems of high speed aircraft .
the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of
aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international
congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for
achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody
arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and
streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low
supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading
edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more .
no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable
geometry .
in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of
 flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it
 is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the
knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are
described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control
methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground
effect on maximum lift .
more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use
involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow
and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of
the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static
longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of
 available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments
due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control,
and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional
stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed .
finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised .
the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying
some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it
is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of
these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants .
two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some
detail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an
avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are
described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the
piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort .
 some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and
phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn .
a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling
requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .

reynolds number varied with mach number, being typically 2 3 x 10 at m
leading edge .
it is shown that the flow pattern at moderate incidences develops
smoothly from a subsonic type involving leading-edge separation to a
supersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge and
with shock-induced separation further aft . the formation and movement
of the shock-wave system and the vortices near the wing surface are
briefly discussed .

experiments with a tapered swept-back wing of warren 12 planform at mach
 numbers between 0.6 and 1.6 .
the development of the flow pattern on a wing of aspect ratio 2 828,
taper ratio 0 333, leading-edge sweepback 53 5 deg and 6 per cent
thickness/chord ratio in the streamwise direction has been described in
part 1, which discussed oil-flow patterns obtained on the surface of the
 wing . the complete programme of tests also included pressure plotting
at four spanwise stations and force measurements . these are discussed
in relation to the flow development in this part of the report .
the wing was tested at mach numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 for incidences
up to about 14 deg . the tunnel stagnation pressure was held constant at
a value near atmospheric pressure during the tests, so that the reynolds
 number varied with mach number .. at m 1 0 it was 2 3 x 10 based on the
 mean aerodynamic chord . boundary-layer transition was fixed by a
roughness band at the leading edge .
a detailed analysis has been made of the pressure distributions on the
surface of the wing and the chordwise distributions integrated to
determine the spanwise loading . the overall lift and pitching moment of
 the wing were also obtained from these data, as well as from direct
measurements using a strain-gauge balance, by means of which the wing
drag was also determined . these results are considered in some detail
to illustrate the effects of mach number and incidence on the flow about
 the model . a preliminary analysis is also made of the conditions for
boundary-layer separation due to shock waves on the wing surface . the
principal factor appears to be the component of mach number normal to
the shock front .

an investigation at transonic speeds of the performance of various
distributed roughness bands used to cause boundary layer transition
near the leading edge of a cropped delta half-wing .
distributed roughness bands of no.320 and no.500 carborundum were found
to be effective in causing boundary-layer transition if they extended
over the first 5( and 10( respectively of the local chord . use of
larger grain sizes, or increases in the band width for a given grain
size resulted in a drag penalty . with very large particle sizes /about
between the particles . the drag penalty was constant over the test mach
 number range /0.80 to 1.15/ and decreased slowly with incidence . the
wing lift and pitching moment were only slightly modified by the
presence of any of the roughness bands tested, but this result would not
 of course necessarily apply to wings of other planforms or section
shapes . the test reynolds number was about 2.7 million .
in the appendix, the structure of the roughness bands is discussed, as
well as the details of the materials used and the techniques used to

summary . an investigation has been made in the n.p.l. 18 in. x 14 in .
tunnel of the effects of leading-edge modifications on the flow and
forces on an untapered wing of 50 deg leading-edge sweep, at stream mach
 numbers between 0 60 and 1 20 . seven leading-edge profiles were
tested, ranging from a drooped extension of 18 per cent of the chord of
the basic sharp-nosed section to a round-nosed section with a
leading-edge radius of 1 0 per cent of the basic chord .
leading-edge droop was found to increase the wing drag near zero lift
but to reduce appreciably the lift-dependent drag component, except at
the highest test mach numbers . droop also increased the lift
coefficient at which leading-edge separation occurred on the upper surface
at moderate subsonic speeds, but in addition reduced the mach number for
 transonic flow attachment . the appearance of the forward shock /but
not the rear shock/ is considerably delayed when the leading edge is
drooped .
with the undrooped sections an increase in leading-edge radius was
accompanied by successively earlier appearances of the forward shock,
and hence the outboard shock with its attendant separation . the
conditions at which the rear shock first appeared changed only slowly as the
section was changed .
the variations in wing flow pattern as the leading edge is modified are
discussed and related to measured changes in the wing lift and drag .
an attempt is also made to estimate the local mach numbers on some parts
 of the wing from the oil-flow patterns,. this material is used to
assess the flow conditions appropriate to shock-induced separation .
the main section of the report concludes with a tentative discussion of
the significance of the present results to the design of swept wings .
in an appendix results obtained with the wing in a sweptforward
configuration are briefly considered .

interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .

interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important
effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been
written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surface .
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this point .
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separation .
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .
some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of
 the paper .

some effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests on
two-dimensional aerofoils at high subsonic and transonic speeds .
in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national
physical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum,
 in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects
experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the
risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .
this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working
sections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect
corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height
normally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open
area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant
proportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number
separated flows . the observed trends in the variation of the blockage
effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from
those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more
 generally until these trends have been checked by further
investigations .
it is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly
influence the manner in which separated flows develop with increasing
incidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open area .
examples are also given of effects of distortions in the local
supersonic flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively large
open areas .

wall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model .
tests have been made in three n.p.l. wind tunnels on a pressure-plotting
 model consisting of a long cylinder with a hemispherical nose . the
surface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbers
between 0.7 and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs
were taken . the blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120( .
the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size
on the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model
with increasing stream mach number . this is thought to depend mainly
on the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel,
and not necessarily on the blockage ratio . the distance of the solid
sidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the
terminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near
 the model nose .

experimental study of the equivalence of transonic
flow about slender cone-cylinders of circular and elliptic
cross section .
  this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence
relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by
transonic slender-body theory .  the models chosen for this study are a
flat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of
revolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flows
about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the
theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to
cone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of
approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares
favorably with jones' slender-wing theory .
  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and
at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic
characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use
of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent
body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate
nonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced
that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that
required for the successful application of the transonic area rule .

the behaviour of supersonic flow past a body of revolution
far from the axis .
a theory is developed of the supersonic flow past a body of revolution
at large distances from the axis, where a linearized approximation is
valueless owing to the divergence of the characteristics at infinity .
it is used to find the asymptotic forms of the equations of the shocks
which are formed from the neighbourhoods of the nose and tail .  in the
special case of a slender pointed body, the general theory at large
distances is used to modify the linearized approximation to give a
theory which is uniformly valid at all distances from the axis .  the
results which are of physical importance are summarized in the
conclusion (9) and compared with the results of experimental
observations .

  the position and strength of the front shock wave at large

theory for the combination, using a method developed by whitham .  the
combination consists of a body of revolution and a wing which has
thickness and is lifting .  the effects of interference between the flow
over the body and the flow over the wing are included .  in any
direction the flow far from the wing-body combination is equivalent to
the flow past a body of revolution determined from the configuration of
the combination .  the modified formulae for unsteady flow are given and
some results are evaluated for the combination of a body of revolution
and a delta wing with subsonic leading edges .

a flight test investigation of the sonic boom .
  the /sonic boom/ as it is now popularly called, has become the
center of considerable interest during the past few years because of
widespread public disturbance and possible damage that can result
from it .  in the hopes of minimizing this disturbance and to extend
the general knowledge of the shock waves which produce the booming
noise, the aeronautical research laboratory, wright air development
center, has initiated an extensive research program to study the sonic
boom phenomenon .
  this report presents the results of flight tests undertaken as one
phase of this program .  the tests had as their objective the
determination and measurement of the shock wave pressure pattern surrounding
an f-100 aircraft in level supersonic flight .
  the flight tests were conducted at the air force flight test
center, edwards air force base, california, under the authority of air
research and development command test directive no. 5524-f1 .

ground measurements of the shock wave noise from airplanes
in level flight at mach numbers to 1. 4 and at altitudes
to 45,000 feet .
  time histories of noise pressures near ground level were measured
during flight tests of fighter-type airplanes over fairly flat, partly
wooded terrain in the mach number range between 1.13 and 1.4 and at
altitudes from 25,000 to 45,000 feet .  atmospheric soundings and
radar-tracking studies were made for correlation with the measured noise
data .
  the measured and calculated values of the pressure rise across the
shock wave were generally in good agreement .  there is a tendency for
the theory to overestimate the pressure at locations remote from the
track and to underestimate the pressures for conditions of high tailwind
at altitude .  the measured values of ground-reflection factor averaged
about 1.8 for the surfaces tested as compared to a theoretical value
of 2.0 .  two booms were measured in all cases .  the observers also
generally reported two booms,. although, in some cases, only one boom
was reported .  the shock-wave noise associated with some of the flight
tests was judged to be objectionable by ground observers, and in one
case the cracking of a plate-glass store window was correlated in time
with the passage of the airplane at an altitude of 25,000 feet .

ground measurements of airplane shock wave noise at
mach numbers to 2, and at altitudes of 60,000 feet .
  the intensity of shock-wave noise at the ground resulting from
flights at mach numbers to 2.0 and altitudes to 60,000 feet was
measured .  measurements near the ground track for flights of a
supersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber are
presented .
  level cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet and a mach
number of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to be
tolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher
altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the
size and weight of the test airplanes .  the measured variation of
sonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the
variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48 .
  the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between
mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0, a result in agreement with the theory .  no
amplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effects
was apparent near the cutoff mach number .
  a method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoff
mach number is shown .  experimental results indicate agreement with the
method, since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreased
intensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at
about the same altitude and mach number .
  comparison of sound pressure levels for the fighter and bomber
airplanes indicated little effect of either airplane size or weight at an
altitude of 40,000 feet .

the shock wave noise problem of supersonic aircraft

  data are presented which provide
an insight into the nature of the
shock-wave noise problem, the significant
variables involved, and the
manner in which airplane operation
may be affected .  flight-test data
are also given, and a comparison with
the available theory is made .  an
attempt is also made to correlate the
subjective reactions of observers
and some associated physical phenomena
with the pressure amplitudes
during full-scale flight .
  it is indicated that for the proposed
supersonic transport airplanes
of the future, booms on the ground will
most probably be experienced
during the major portion of the flight
plan .  the boom pressures will be
most severe during the climb and descent
phases of the flight plan .
during the cruise phase of the flight,
the boom pressures are of much
lesser intensity but are spread laterally
for many miles .  the manner
in which the airplane is operated appears
to be significant,. for example,
the boom pressures during the climb,
cruise, and descent phases can be
minimized by operating the airplane at
its maximum altitude consistent

an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity
of sonic booms .
  this paper is a brief summary of
an investigation made to check the effect of lift
on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic
speeds .  the method of hayes has been
combined with the theory of whitham to
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies
and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as
general, method was derived by walkden in
ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the
volume term, has been used extensively to predict
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,
been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.
altitude and the calculations of this paper show
that under those conditions the shock noise of
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,
be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will
dominate for even the small fighter and they will
dominate over most of the altitude range
for large bomber and supersonic transport
aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases
with altitude as which compares to
in the volume case (=pressure at
altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,
wing loading, wing plan shape and
lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating
the shock noise due to combined volume and
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to
configurations with wings located towards the
rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting
volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is
presented from which rapid estimates can be
made of the shock noise of lifting
wing-body combinations .

the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred
to a body-axis system .
  the linearized equations of motion have been derived for a rolling
missile having slight aerodynamic asymmetries .  time histories of
rolling-missile motions referred to a body-axis system have been
prepared to show the types of missile motions that can be encountered .
the motions resulting from a trim change and a pulse-rocket disturbance
are shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity to
pitching frequency .
  finally, the derived equations are used in establishing a technique
for the reduction of rolling-missile oscillation data .  it is shown
that the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data if
four accelerations are measured .  the method is applied to the results
obtained from a flight test of a missile configuration .

stability derivatives of cones at supersonic speeds .
  the aerodynamic stability derivatives due to pitching velocity and
vertical acceleration are calculated by use of potential theory for
circular cones traveling at supersonic speeds .  the analysis is based on
two theoretical techniques used successfully previously in application
to the case of uniform axial and inclined flow .  in the first,
potential solutions for axial flow and crossflow are derived from the
first-order wave equation but in application to calculations for the
forces no approximations are made either to the tangency condition or
to the isentropic pressure relation .  the second method consists in
combining the first-order crossflow potential with an axial-flow
potential correct to second order .  closed-form solutions by both
methods are found for a cone, and numerical results for the stability
derivatives are presented as a function of mach number for cones having
semivertex angles of 10 and 20 .
  in addition, expressions for the forces, moments, and stability
derivatives of arbitrary bodies of revolution are obtained using
newtonian impact theory .  numerical results for cones compare well
with those obtained from the combined first- and second-order potential
theory at the highest mach number for which the latter theory is
applicable .

investigation of several blunt bodies to determine
trans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects
of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some
measurements of unsteady base pressures .
  several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for
atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic
characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 .  the tests
were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds
numbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .
  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed
the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve
slopes .  the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears
to be subject to mach number effects .  spinning a full-skirted body
about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the
pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static
stability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  the
extension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a
short-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability
only if the flaps extended into the airstream .
  some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two
dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach
number in these tests .  there is doubt, however, that these pressures
can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle
because of their small amplitude and phasing .

pitching-moment characteristics at a mach number of 3.11 and a reynolds
number of 6 x 10 based on maximum body diameter of 2 inches .
  the results of the tests showed that all the bodies were statically
stable about a point located one-third of the body length from the
nose .  the results also showed that high-drag bodies which have a large
portion of their afterbodies negatively sloped (decrease in
cross-sectional area from nose to base) may have a negative lift-curve slope .
this negative slope results from the large negative lift component of
the axial force obtained with those bodies and the fact that with
negatively sloped afterbodies only small normal forces are developed .

theories of plastic buckling .
  the theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appears
finally to have achieved a satisfactory form, rests upon the
well-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development of
a correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of
plates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established
polyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .
  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond
the elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow
and deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based on
deformation theories are in better agreement with experiment
than those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests in
which a material is compressed into the plastic range and then
subjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better
agreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimate
doubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for
the plastic buckling of plates .
  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a new
theory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the
flow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept of
slip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less
by mathematical, considerations than previous theories .
experimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in
better agreement with the new theory than with either flow or
deformation theories .  the new theory accounts for the apparent
contradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use of
deformation theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .

effects of imperfections on buckling of thin cylinders
and columns under axial compression .
  von karman and tsien have shown that under elastic
conditions the resistance of perfect thin cylinders
subjected to axial compression drops precipitously after
buckling .  it is considered that this indicates that this type of
buckling is very sensitive to imperfections or disturbances .
in this paper the effects of certain imperfections of shape
turbances combined) are studied by the large-deflection
shell theory developed in a previous paper (2) .
  it is found that two types of buckling failure may occur .
one is of a purely elastic type which occurs when the peak
of the average stress versus average strain curve is reached,
while the other type is precipitated by yielding, which for
thicker cylinders or lower-yield material may occur before
such a peak is reached .  curves are derived giving the
dependence of each type of failure upon the dimensions and
elastic and yield properties of the specimen and also upon
an /unevenness factor/ u which determines the
magnitude of the initial imperfections and is assumed to depend
on the method of fabrication .  the relations derived are in
line with test results, and similar studies of the buckling
of struts indicate that the magnitude of the initial
imperfections which have to be assumed to explain test strengths
are reasonable .

on the concept of stability of inelastic systems .
  simple models are employed to bring out the large and
important differences between buckling in the plastic range and
classical elastic instability .  static and kinetic criteria are
compared and their interrelation discussed .  nonlinear behavior in
particular is often found to be the key to the physically valid
solution .  the nonconservative nature of plastic deformation in
itself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires concepts
not found in classical approaches .  conversely, the classical
linearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevant
in inelastic buckling .  plastic buckling loads are not uniquely
defined but cover a range of values and are often more properly
thought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initial
imperfection in geometry or dynamic disturbance .
  the models indicate that basically the same information is
obtained from essentially static systems by assuming initial
imperfection in geometric forms as by assuming dynamic
disturbances .  one approach complements the other and both are
helpful in obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena .

inelastic instability and incremental theories of plasticity .
  a most troublesome paradox has existed for a number of years
with respect to buckling in the plastic range .  theoretical
considerations and all direct experimental evidence show
conclusively that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theory
of plasticity is valid .  however, the results of plastic buckling
tests are well correlated by a simple total or deformation theory
and bear no resemblance to published predictions of incremental
theory .
  the suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shape
or loading might well explain this most peculiar result .
however, subsequent investigations by several authors seem to have
given the impression that excessively large imperfections would
be needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to the
magnitude of such imperfections .
  it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely
small, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do
account for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load is
shown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection .
the example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangular
plate hinged along one edge and free on the other under
uniform compressive stress at the ends .  this is the equivalent of
the case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbing
in the past because incremental theory applied to a perfect
cruciform column did lead to an entirely incorrect result .

small bending and stretching of sandwich type shells .
  a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of
sandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory
of homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are
important in the present problem, which have not been considered
previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of
transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress
deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of
importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was
found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no
counterpart in flat-plate theory .
  the general results of this report have been applied to the
solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular
cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical
examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects
of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .
  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of
taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type
shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between
the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the
composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse
shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to
be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse
core flexibility .
  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the
geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration
so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic
modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .
  solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be
obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed
in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse
shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does
not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .

a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin
elastic shallow spherical shells .
  a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure
for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at
relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one
for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in
the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for
structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question
arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the
classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to
infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy
criterion/ proposed by tsien .
  in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling
of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and
experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations
are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of
the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the
coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome
is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its
thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge
rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load
according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t,
convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the
buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however
even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined
for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs .
these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t
increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied,
the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .
  experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion
of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the
theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for
higher domes is also indicated .

stresses and small displacements of shallow spherical
shells .
  the purpose of the present paper is to derive a system of
equations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments of
thin, elastic, spherical shells .  a segment will be called shallow if
the ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, say .  the
results obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also be
applicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loads
are such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zones .
  the problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject of
numerous researches .  for the rotationally symmetric case the
fundamental results were obtained in 1912 (1) and have been the starting
point of many applications .  while it is possible to deduce from these
results approximate equations equivalent to part of what follows, it is
believed that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell
may be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric cases .
  a number of investigations have been concerned with the shell loaded
in a non-rotationally symmetric manner (2,3,4) .  in its general form
this problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are not
easy to apply .  restricting attention to the shallow shell in the
manner of the present paper brings with it a very considerable
simplification of the analysis .

stability of thin-walled tubes under torsion .
  in this paper a theoretical solution is developed for the
torsion on a round thin-walled tube for which the walls
become unstable .  the results of this theory are given by
a few simple formulas and curves which cover all cases .
the differential equations of equilibrium are derived in a
simpler form than previously found, it being shown that
many items can be neglected .  the solution obtained is
length ratio is zero and infinite, and is a good
approximation for intermediate cases .  the theory is compared
with all available experiments, including about 50 tests
made by the author .  the experimental-failure torque is
always smaller than the theoretical-buckling torque,
averaging about 75 percent of it, with a minimum of 60
percent .  as the form of the deflection checks closely with
that predicted by theory and the experiments cover a great
range of shapes and materials, this discrepancy can
reasonably be ascribed largely to initial eccentricities in
actual tubes .

nonlinear deflections of shallow spherical shells .
  the equations obtained by chien for the nonlinear deflection
of shallow spherical shells under uniform external pressure are
solved by means of power series expansions, following procedures
introduced by friedrichs and stoker in their treatment of
buckling of circular plates .  these equations depend upon two
parameters .  one of these parameters is related to the external
pressure, while the other depends upon the dimensions of the shell .
the equations are solved for several ranges of the parameters
under boundary conditions corresponding to a fixed edge .
  the solution, carried out numerically on the aec univac

stresses and deflections as functions of the polar angle over a
wide range of values of the loading parameter and the
dimensional parameter .  prediction of the upper buckling load is then
made by means of a numerical criterion based on the load vs.
deflection curve .  for some cases, the postbuckling behavior
is investigated .  the results agree well with existing

inelastic behaviour of structures subjected to cyclic

  a general analytical procedure is outlined for structures subjected to
varying thermal and mechanical stressing conditions .  consideration is
given to the accumulation of time-independent plastic strains and creep
strains .  stress-strain-temperature-time relations for uniaxial and
multiaxial stresses are defined, based on various material behavior
assumptions .  several of the assumptions are compared with a limited
number of time-varying temperature and uniaxial stress tests .
  the procedure is illustrated by its application to uniaxial stress
problems in which /planes originally plane remain plane/ and to plane
stress plate problems .  a solution, based on the influence coefficient
approach to the plane stress plate problem, is obtained which is
applicable to all plate plan forms, edge boundary conditions, and
inplane thermal and mechanical loading conditions .
  from the predicted inelastic behavior of a three-bar structure
subjected to cyclic thermal and mechanical loading conditions, it is
shown that eventual failure could result from large permanent
deformation accumulations, tensile rupture, or thermal-stress-fatigue .
  a sample plate with a centrally located hole was analyzed for two
cycles of a time-varying temperature and edge stress condition .  both
plastic strain reversals and plastic strain growths were predicted at

semiempirical design procedure for the determination of the buckling
strength of unpressurized and pressurized cylinders under axial
compression .  this procedure has been extended in the present
paper to the bending of unpressurized and pressurized cylindrical
shells and allows the calculation of the critical bending stress with
a knowledge of the cylinder geometry and the internal pressure
only .
  because no published data could be found, an extensive series
of bending tests of pressurized cylinders has been performed .
these new data for pressurized cylinders are treated
semiempirically together with all of the other known test data for
unpressurized cylinders .  best-fit curves are presented using applicable
theoretical parameters .  design curves for determining the
critical buckling stress for unpressurized and pressurized cylinders
in bending are then developed as 90 per cent probability curves
from the test data .

  a theory is derived to predict the stresses and deformations of

the membrane wrinkles .  rather than studying in detail the deformations
in the wrinkled region, the present theory studies average displacements
of the wrinkled material .  specific solutions of problems in flat and
curved membranes are presented .  the results of these solutions show
that membrane structures retain much of their stiffness at loads

a simplified method of elastic stability analysis for
thin cylindrical shells .
  the equation for the equilibrium of cylindrical
shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to
find the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is
applied to find critical stresses for cylinders with
simply supported edges under other loading conditions .
it is shown that by this method solutions may be obtained
very easily and the results in each case may be expressed
in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one dependent
on the critical stress and the other essentially
determined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of
boundary conditions related to edge displacements in the
shell median surface is discussed .  the accuracy of the
solutions found is established by comparing them with
previous theoretical solutions and with test results .
  the solutions to a number of problems concerned with
buckling of cylinders with simply supported edges on the
basis of a unified viewpoint are presented in a convenient
form for practical use .

flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindrical
shells having freely supported ends .
the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thin
cylinders and a theoretical and experimental investigation is made of
the type of vibration usually associated with bells .  the cylinders are
supported in such a manner that the ends remain circular without
directional restraint being imposed .  it is found that the complexity
of the mode of vibration bears little relation to the natural
frequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameter
ratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may have
many of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes of
vibration .  the frequency equation which is derived by the energy
method is based on strain relations given by timoshenko .  in this
approach, displacement equations are evolved which are comparable to
those of love and flugge, though differences are evident due to the
strain expressions used by each author .  results are given for
cylinders of various lengths, each with the same thickness-diameter
ratio, and also for a very thin cylinder in which the simpler modes of
vibration occur in the higher frequency range .  it is shown that there
are three possible natural frequencies for a particular nodal pattern,
two of these normally occurring beyond the aural range .

the flexural vibrations of thin cylinders .
the flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylinders are considered .
in this type of vibration many forms of nodal pattern may exist owing to
the combination of circumferential and axial nodes .  theoretical
expressions are developed for the natural frequencies of cylinders with
freely-supported and fixed ends and a comparison is made with the
frequencies obtained experimentally .
  in practice, the ends of cylinders are subjected to a certain degree
of fixing by end-plates, flanges, etc., and the natural frequencies thus
lie between the corresponding values for freely-supported and fixed
ends .  to make possible the estimation of such frequencies, a method is
devised in which an equivalent wavelength factor is used .  this factor
represents the wavelength of the freely-supported cylinder that would
have the same frequency as the cylinder under consideration when
vibrating in the same mode .  the results of experimental investigations
with various end thicknesses and flange dimensions are recorded, and
from these the equivalent factors are derived .
  sets of curves calculated for cylinders with freely-supported ends and
covering a range of cylinder thicknesses are given .  from these it is
possible to obtain close approximation to the frequencies of cylinders
under other end conditions by the use of an appropriate factor .  an
example is given of frequency calculations for a large air-receiver for
which two frequencies were identified by experiment .

on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal
pressure .
  the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled
circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered .
it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure
has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics .
for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to
diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency
is in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number of
circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated
with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p .
if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p
when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest
frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal
pressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequency
spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the
frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential
nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal
pressure .
  experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration
modes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinders
subjected to internal pressure are briefly described .  these
results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's
  the effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfect
circular symmetry is discussed .

median-surface cross section is described analytically by a simple
expression corresponding to a family of doubly symmetric ovals .  the
cylinder is under a uniform lateral load and is simply supported at its
edges .  the small deflection analysis considered is based upon a series
solution of appropriate differential equations of shell theory which
leads ultimately to infinite sets of algebraic equations, truncated
forms of which are considered .  numerical values of the significant
stresses and displacements for points of the oval cylinder, which are 5
percent of the axial length and 2.5 percent of the circumferential
length apart, have been calculated for an oval cross section with a

some experimental studies of panel flutter at mach
1 .3.
  experimental studies of panel flutter were conducted at a mach
number of 1.3 to verify the existence of this phenomenon and to study the
effects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristics .
thin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and were
mounted as a section of the tunnel wall .  most of the data were obtained by
using aluminum-alloy panels, although a few steel, magnesium, and brass
panels were also used .  different materials with various thicknesses
and lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters on
panel flutter .  the experimental program consisted of three phases ..
panels clamped front and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on all
four edges .
  panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions
and it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasing
tensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as were
shortening the panels or increasing the bending stiffness .  no apparent
systematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed,
and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved higher
modes and frequencies .  the presence of a pressure differential between
the two surfaces of a panel was observed to have a stabilizing effect .
initially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panels
without buckling .  buckled panels with all four edges clamped were much
less prone to flutter than buckled panels clamped front and rear .

  experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbers

tested .  the effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter
sure, e is young's modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness and
length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped on
the front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 0.44
is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-length
ratio is 0.69 .  an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled
panels clamped on four edges, with width-length ratios of 0.21 to 4.0 .
this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the
panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than
approximately 0.5 .  panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half waves
in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to
flutter .  the results of limited tests on panels with applied damping,

  skin-stiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, each

stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 655 f .  the panels were
restrained by the supporting structure in such a manner that partial thermal
expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral
directions .
  a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points
consisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and a
transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries .  in the region
where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel
skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more
susceptible to flutter .  in the region where a panel must be buckled
when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed .  this reversal in
trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .

addition, a few tests were made on the lower vertical stabilizer of the
x-15 airplane which has external-skin panels unsupported for a length
  all panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increase
in panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermally
induced stress prior to buckling .  after buckling the panels showed
flutter boundaries characterized by a decrease in thickness required to
prevent flutter with further increases in thermal stress .  the largest
thickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamic
heating occurred at the transition between the flat-panel boundary and
the buckled-panel boundary .  this peak value (for aluminum-alloy panel)
was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for an
unheated, unloaded panel .
  values of the modified-thickness-ratio flutter parameter for the
unstressed panels (obtained by extrapolation) were in fair agreement for
the aluminum, steel, and x-15 stabilizer panels .  peak values at
transition, however, showed large differences due to apparently minor
changes in panel-support construction and or changes in panel-skin

an attempt has been made to identify the significant factors governing

mainly by using a laboratory technique with hot and cold fluidized beds

generally more damaging than a succession of cooling shocks between the

upper temperature of the cycle are dominant factors .  the
thermal-fatigue cracks are initiated at the surface and are intercrystalline in

the calculation of transient temperature in turbine
blades and tapered discs using biot's variational method .
  transient temperatures in aerofoil
sections and tapered discs are
calculated taking advantage of simplifications
in heat flow analysis
achieved in biot's variational method .
cross-sections are represented by
a line of adjacent squares of various
sizes suitable for the local
dimensions, e.g. small squares near the leading
and trailing edges .  the
potential, dissipation and surface dissipation
functions of biot's method are
set up, and the lagrange equations lead,
by automatic procedures, to an
eigenvalue formulation in matrix form for
the temperatures and their first
time derivatives .  solutions are sums
of exponentials in time, and are
evaluated by digital computer, requiring
about five minutes for each
cross-section and heat transfer coefficient .
transient temperatures in a
particular aerofoil section for variation
of heat transfer coefficient and for
external temperature depending exponentially
on time agree with results
obtained on an analogue computer .
maximum transient temperature
differences are evaluated for tapered discs
by a simple electrical analogue) with
variation of edge radius and heat
transfer coefficient .  peculiarities
in the solution for cyclic
temperature external to an aerofoil over
a range of frequencies indicate
limitations in the mathematical formulation .
a successful solution for cyclic
external temperature might enable
eigenvalues to be separated out in
experimental measurements using
electronic equipment, and this might be
extended to exponential external
temperature if a relationship between
cyclic and exponential external
temperature could be established .
eigenvalues and eigenvectors as discrete
values arise fictitiously from the
sub-division into squares and the
possibility of an integral formulation
is mentioned .  there is a possible,
but not immediate, extension to
cooled blades, whose cross-sections
are multiply-connected regions .
transient stresses due to creep, and
viscoelasticity might be included .

effect of rheological behaviour on thermal stresses .
  since the conventional elastic analysis of thermal stress problems
coupled with limiting creep rates and time-dependent fracture stresses
as (inelastic) design criteria, results in design procedures for thermal
stresses (in heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, flight structures at
supersonic speeds, etc.) of considerable unreality, the effect of
various types of rheological behavior (viscoelastic, plastic, work
hardening) on the level of thermal stresses is analyzed under simplified
assumptions, such as uniaxial stress and polar or cylindrical symmetry .
the effect on the thermal stress intensity of the rheological behavior
of the material is shown to be very significant, particularly with
respect to stress relaxation and the development of residual stresses .

fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise
temperature variations .
  boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a
sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow .  it is
shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial
distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall
temperature by an angle of 30 to 45 .  this leads to the
conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the
temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer
coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept .
the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the
temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion .  the distortion
is measured by the peclet number .  approximate equations
representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis
and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined
with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength .  a
solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity
profile which is not a straight line .  the use of previously developed
variational principles for the evaluation of convective heat
transfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow,
turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed .

lagrangian thermodynamics of heat transfer in systems

  the lagrangian thermodynamic equations of irreversible

generalization provides equations for the unified analysis of transient
heat flow in complex systems comprising solid structures and
moving fluids in either laminar or turbulent flow .  the concept
of a surface-heat-transfer coefficient is eliminated from the
formulation .  the theory is developed along two different lines .  in
one approach a new concept referred to as the /trailing function/
is introduced .  it represents the surface-heat-transfer properties
and may be evaluated by quite simple but remarkably accurate
variational procedures .  the method of /associated fields/ is also
generalized to convective phenomena .  the second line of
approach extends to convective heat transfer the thermodynamic
concept of entropy production for both laminar and turbulent
flow .  the theory amounts to an extension of the
thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems for which onsager's

.W
the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds .
the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter
speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is
therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for
the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is
necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small
suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a
reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in
most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted
at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present
paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the
critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make
the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to
reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the
critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities
may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model .
the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter
speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected
 by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are
equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are
the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less
 than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that
the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail
in a flutter .
lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is
negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model .
gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation
 of the model .

on flutter testing in high speed wind tunnels .
  the requirements for simulating in a wind tunnel flutter conditions
appropriate to high-speed flight are discussed, and an assessment is
made of the desirable features of a wind tunnel suitable for flutter
testing at transonic and supersonic speeds .
  it is concluded that such a tunnel should have either the mach number
or the stagnation pressure variable during the tunnel run, and that it
is of considerable advantage, and for some purposes essential, for high
stagnation pressures to be available .  the stagnation pressure required
to allow flight conditions to be simulated with a flutter model is
considered to range from at least 2 atmospheres for transonic speeds to
about 15 atmospheres for m = 4 .  no attempt to simulate kinetic heating
is envisaged, although its effect on stiffness should be allowed for in
the design of the model .  to minimise uncertainties due to the
variation of the model stiffness with temperature it is desirable that
means for controlling the stagnation temperature should be incorporated
in the tunnel .

cumulative damage in fatigue .
  the phenomenon of cumulative damage under repeated
loads was assumed to be related to the net work absorbed
by a specimen .  the number of loading cycles applied
expressed as a percentage of the number to failure at a
given stress level would be the proportion of useful life
expended .  when the total damage, as defined by this
concept, reached 100 per cent, the fatigue specimen should
fail .  experimental verification of this concept for an
aluminum alloy, using different types of specimens,
various stress ratios, and various combinations of loading
cycles is presented .  these data are also analyzed to
provide information on different stress ratios when an s-n
curve for any one ratio is known .  results of a sample
analysis based on experiments are given .  it is

a simplified method of elastic stability analysis for
thin cylindrical shells .
  this paper develops a new method for determining the buckling
stresses of cylindrical shells under various loading conditions .
for convenience of exposition, it is divided into two parts .
  in part 1, the equation for the equilibrium of cylindrical
shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to find
the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find
critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under
other loading conditions .  it is shown that by this method
solutions may be obtained very easily and the results in each case may
be expressed in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one
dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially
determined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of boundary
conditions related to edge displacements in the shell median
surface is discussed .  the accuracy of the solutions found is
established by comparing them with previous theoretical solutions
and with test results .  the solutions to a number of problems
concerned with buckling of cylinders with simply supported
edges on the basis of a unified viewpoint are presented in a
convenient form for practical use .
  in part 2, a modified form of donnell's equation for the
equilibrium of thin cylindrical shells is derived which is
equivalent to donnell's equation but has certain advantages in physical
interpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the case
of shells having clamped edges .  the solution of this modified
equation by means of trigonometric series and its application to
a number of problems concerned with the shear buckling stresses
of cylindrical shells are discussed .  the question of implicit
boundary conditions also is considered .

comments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells' .
in the recent paper by zuk, an expression was presented for
the critical buckling temperature of a clamped cylindrical shell
in terms of the material and geometrical properties of the shell .
restraint at the edges of the shell was assumed to be provided by
rigid frames experiencing no temperature rise .
the circumferential stress induced in the shell when it experienced
a temperature rise, t, may be approximated by the function .
in other words, there is a compressive circumferential stress along
the entire length, l, of the shell .
it is well known, however, that the discontinuity stresses introduced at
the junction of a shell and a rigid frame (or bulk-head) are extremely
localized, and the circumferential stresses induced in the shell
decrease rapidly away from the joint .

flutter of a two dimensional simply supported buckled

  the critical flutter speed is evaluated for a two-dimensional thin
buckled panel with one surface exposed to a supersonic airstream and the
other to still air at the same static pressure .  the panel is simply
supported along the leading and trailing edges by rigid edge members
separated by an elastic member represented by a compression spring .
the whole system is acted upon by a constant compressive force uniformly
distributed along the edge members .  the aerodynamic forces acting on
the deflected panel are found from two-dimensional /quasi-steady/
theory, valid for slow oscillations where the downwash velocity is small
compared with the speed of flow and provided that the mach number is
sufficiently greater than .  the elastic behaviour of the panel is given
by von karman's large deflection equations modified to cover initially
curved plates .  the solution of the equations is carried out by means
of galerkin's method, which has been shown to give valid results for
a panel with a non-zero bending rigidity .
  the influence of the midplane compressive force carried by the panel
itself, the initial buckle amplitude and the elastic restraint against
edge displacements is investigated, and curves are presented giving the
critical dynamic pressure ratio as a function of these variables .

aerodynamic effects on boundary layer unsteadiness .
  with a view to the study of
aerodynamic problems, a review is made
of boundary layer theory for a flat
plate moving with a time-dependent
velocity .  unsteady effects are shown
to enter according to the magnitude
of the ratio of time for diffusion to act
throughout the boundary layer to the
characteristic time of the imposed unsteadiness .
  it is concluded that a boundary layer
may be considered quasi-steady
even during extreme flight manocuvres .
generation of acoustic noise purely
by boundary layer unsteadiness is generally
small .  thermal and heat-transfer
effects are cited .
  unsteady boundary layer considerations
are important in damping or
amplifying certain instabilities, such as flutter
of panels and stalling flutter of
aerofoils .  in connection with the aerofoil
problem, laminar separation
concepts and the stagnation-point boundary
layer are described for unsteady

long slender delta wings with leading edge separation .
  the slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow is
applied to the problem of a delta wing in which flow separation occurs
at the leading edges .  the vortex sheets found in the real flow are
approximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, and a
plausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate the
force-free nature of the vortex sheet .
  the computations show that leading-edge separation produces an
increase in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory and
that the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attack .  computed
pressure distributions and span loadings are presented and the
theoretical lift results are compared with the results of simple force tests
made at a mach number of 1.9 .

some current and proposed investigations into the flow
for slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion .
  the practical need for research
into the aerodynamics of
slender delta wings in unsteady motion has
been emphasized in a recent
paper by zbrozek .  two important aspects
are ..  -      formation and presence of
      leading-edge vortices .
      with oscillatory or transient
      modes of longitudinal (or
      chordwise) bending .
  the first of the aspects
above, has already been briefly
discussed in ref. 2 .  one feature of
the flow with leading-edge vortices
which seems to be of particular
significance to the dynamic behaviour
of a wing is the shedding of vorticity
at the leading edge as well as at
the trailing edge .  any time-dependent
motion, or distortion, of the wing
leads to a change in the rate at which
vorticity is shed .  with more
conventional types of flow, the free
vorticity being shed only from the
trailing edge has diminishing influence
on the wing, but when the free
vorticity is shed from the leading edge,
in passing downstream, it
remains close to the upper surface of the
wing .  it might be expected
then, that, although the magnitudes of the
unsteady forces may not be
greatly affected for a slender delta, the
time delays associated with
the forces may be significantly different
for the attached and
separated regimes of leading-edge flow .

two dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shock
waves .
  a study is made of the unsteady flow around an
airfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation being
such that local supersonic regions terminated by
shock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil .  for
the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations
technique is employed and the interaction with the shock
wave is taken into account .  the case of an oscillating
aileron is considered first, and a solution is derived
for the pressure distribution on the aileron .  it is
found that the solution has a simple form when the
shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the
aileron .  as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a
correction must be added to the solution .  an
interpretation of these results is given .  the results are
compared with results of a theory which neglects the
presence of the shock and it is found that both agree
for m = 1 .  for m   1, however, neglecting the presence
of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of
magnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number
behind the shock .
  the theory is finally extended to include the case
in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the
solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is
treated .  the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer
interaction is discussed and it is shown that this
mechanism can be included in the results of the present
theory .

the interference from head

cavitation and pressure distribution
head forms at zero angle of yaw .
early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institute of hydraulic research
undertook the design and fabrication of a variable-pressure water
tunnel .  as the tunnel neared completion, however, its immediate use
for the study of the pressure distribution around various body forms
was requested .
the original request for this investigation was a natural out-growth
of the need for systematic data on the distribution of pressure
in flow around various bodies, particularly under conditions leading to
cavitation, information which is desirable for the design of a wide
variety of navy equipment .  ultimately the study is to include data
for two- and three-dimensional head and tail forms at various angles of
yaw .  the first phase of the study, namely the investigation of
three-dimensional head forms at zero angle of yaw, is described herein .
three general geometric series have been studied.dash rounded,
ellipsoidal, and conical.dash together with other related forms .
the data obtained have been systematized to yield information for
a wide variety of geometrical forms either directly or by
interpolation .  whenever possible, analytical methods have been used to
corroborate the experimental data and to provide a reliable means
of generalizing the results .

random vibration .
  random vibration is vibration which results
from an excitation which is not well represented by any simple
function (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination of
such functions but which is satisfactorily modeled by a
stochastic process .  it is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration
to say that /all vibration is random vibration ./  every
vibration record contains /hash/ at some level .  nevertheless,
until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able to
get along without including the consideration of random
excitations .
  now in several fields simultaneously there has occurred a
burst of activity in the application of random processes .  the
response of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulence
and the response of ships to confused seas have been put on
reasonably firm footing .  possibly the most dramatic problems
have been posed by the development of large jet and rocket
engines which produce spectacular amounts of random
vibrational energy .  the high level of random vibration in a jet
plane or a missile provides a severe environment with respect
to fatigue failure of structural members and with respect to
malfunctions of sensitive equipment .

as an extension of the pohlhausen solution of a thick

lighthill .  experiments consist of a thermocouple survey of the
temperature field over an electrically-heated brass cylinder of
diameter and 10 ft. height and an interferometric study
of the density field over a bare tungsten wire of 0.02-in. diameter
and 5 ft. height .  the thermal-layer thicknesses are about five
and fifty times the radii of the cylinders, respectively .
experimental results of the local heat-transfer coefficient are in excellent
agreement with the theory .  this, in turn, justifies the theories
of laminar boundary layer along a thin cylinder, at least indirectly .

for certain aero-elastic configurations it is possible to ascertain
critical flutter conditions from static considerations alone .  the
idea is simply one of negation..  when the air speed exceeds a certain
value statically stable equilibrium - and sometimes equilibrium itself
take place .  there are times when the dynamics of a situation are
complex enough to defy a tractable analysis .  the value of being able
to indicate a flutter criterion from the simpler statics is clear .
we will suppose flutter begins when some critical value of the air
speed (or some parameter simply related the to) is exceeded .  here
we will show that there is a critical value which, when exceeded,
precludes static equilibrium .  underlying our work is the premise
that these two critical values are the same .  this assumption begs
discussion .
we will call the lowest value of our air speed parameter to preclude
statically stable equilibrium of the system the transtability value .
in some cases, excess of this value will ban all possibility of
static equilibrium - stable or not., we will then call it a strong
transtability value .

the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic
speeds .
when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio,
 and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shown
that the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbation
potential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation .
the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation in
the free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developed
by adams and sears for steady flow . the method gives solutions valid
for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency .
the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid
 and elastic modes . from the results it can be seen that the special
non-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in
slender-body theory, are very important . stability derivatives can also
 be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may
be negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .

rae r. aero.2468.
.W
a method of calculating the short period longitudinal
stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady
compressible flow .
  a method is developed for the
calculation of the pressure
distribution and the aerodynamic forces and
moments on a wing performing harmonic
pitching and heaving oscillations .
the calculation is based on the
assumption of inviscid potential flow
without shock waves and is
restricted to small incidence, so that the
linearized theory is valid .
  in contrast to other work in the
field the theory applies to all
mach numbers .  it is restricted to small
values of the reduced frequency
and should be valid for the usual range
of short periods occurring at
present in flight .  the formal solution
yields two integral equations for
the parts of the load, which are in phase
and go out of phase with the
oscillation,. these are of the same form
as the corresponding equation
in steady flow .
  the way is thus opened for solutions
over the whole mach number
range at small frequencies, if the
corresponding steady solutions can
be found .  the calculation is in fact
easiest for m = 1 and has been
done here for delta-wings to supplement
a previous supersonic calculation,
made on different frequency assumptions,
which broke down near m = 1 .
it appears from the two sets of results
that the short period oscillation
will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex
angle of the delta wing is
greater than about 60 .  this confirms a
now generally recognised trend .
  such results near m = 1 must of
course be invalidated to an
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and
shock waves at their maximum
effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that
these factors will remove
the critical nature of the transonic damping
as calculated by this method .
with all its obvious limitations this method,
when extended to other
planforms, should provide a useful tool in
studying the effect of
geometrical parameters on the stability of
an aircraft at transonic
speeds .

powers of the aspect ratio in order

the approximate theory of flow about slender bodies and wings originated

paralleling ward's extension for supersonic flow . the calculation of
pressures and forces and the extension of the theory to unsteady flows
are reviewed, and some discrepancies in the published literature are
explained .
finally, interpreting the jones slender-wing result as the first term of
 an expansion in powers of a breadth parameter /e.g., aspect ratio/, it
is shown how a more accurate theory can be developed by carrying
additional terms for both subsonic and supersonic speeds . this theory of
not-so-slender wings is applied to some practical wing problems,
including direct problems of flow past given wings and problems of wing
design for minimum drag . the accuracy of the new results is assessed by
 comparison with linearized supersonic-airfoil theory for the special

post buckling behaviour of circular cylinderical shells
under hydrostatic pressure .
  the postbuckling behavior of initially perfect, thin-walled,
circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure is
investigated with the aid of the principle of stationary potential energy
together with appropriate approximate deflection functions .
calculations show that postbuckling equilibrium configurations
exist for loads greater than as well as loads slightly less than the
critical load calculated from small-deflection theory .  loads
less than the critical load are obtained only for a finite range of a
parameter indicative of shell geometry .  for loads corresponding
to radial displacements of the order of the shell thickness, it is
found that the number of circumferential waves remain
essentially constant with increasing deflection and equal to the
number of waves developed at buckling .

vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic
speeds .
  the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies
of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in
order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex
wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing
interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal
force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local
flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are
discussed and analyzed .
  comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and
center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with
theories which include methods for estimating the effects of
viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly
dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack .
further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and
experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that,
in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing
theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and
distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .
  the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the
circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body
vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter
integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet .
the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in
close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength
formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is
assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical
portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible
potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of
equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however,
in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex
locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined
from experiment .
  the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are,
in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned
incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination
angles which are in good agreement with the measured values,
except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,
and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are
expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple
methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to
substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and
experiment .
  it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be
adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions
represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the
distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are
accurately known .

a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under

a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under
axial compression and bending .
  the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical
shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and
too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good
agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the
assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal
deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6
to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently
considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens
than for duralumin and increases with the radius-
thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between
observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .
  in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is
developed, which permits initial eccentricities or
deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true
instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,.
the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is
assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum
stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial
eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for
the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial
eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,.
however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be
explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are
assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and
if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the
magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with
these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a
function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of
elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this
a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves
relations suggested by the theory but is based on
experimental data .
  it is shown that similar discrepancies between
experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin
cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the
same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can
be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation
buckling problems can probably be explained by similar
considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may
help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems .
the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should
be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other
applications as well .
  the paper presents the results of about a hundred new
tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending,
which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form
the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .

stability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature .
the report is a first attempt to devise a calculation method
for representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells
of variable curvature .  the problem occurs, for instance, in
dimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which is
decisively influenced by the variability of curvature .  the
calculation is made possible by simplifying the stability
equations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) and
by assuming that the curvature as a function of the arc
length s can be represented by a very few fourier terms .
we evaluated the formulas for the special case of an
ellipse-like half oval with an axis ratio under
compression in longitudinal direction, shear, and a combination of
shear and compression .  however, the results can also be
applied approximately to an unsymmetrical oval-shell segment
under compression, shear, and bending so that the numerical
values contained in the diagrams 10 to 12 represent directly
dimensioning data for the wing nose .

general theory of large deflections of thin shells
with special applications to conical shells .
  a general theory is developed for the case of large deflections

system on the surface of the shell can be used .  the effect of initial
imperfections is included .  it is shown that for shells of negligible
gaussian curvature (shallow shells and developable surfaces), the
problem can be reduced to the solution of two fourth-order partial
differential equations in a stress function and the deflection normal to the

the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed
for two-dimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils .
  advances in the practical development of boundary-layer
control for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn
attention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to
artificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window
panels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impact
with insects .  this natural form of roughening, the effects of which
have been noted, though not investigated previously, is the
subject of the present paper .
  the phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely,
and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary
layer .  wind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila,
and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and
airfoils are fully described .  the former problem has also been
treated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published,
agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in
all essentials .
  the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally
of a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an
extensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced and
gradually diminishing value of the excrescence height .  further,
it is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effect
upon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the
down-stream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of a
laminar layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically
smooth .  moreover, it appears that the conditions defining the
upstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are
fundamentally the same as those which determine the critical
state for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three-
dimensional character .

stability of cylindrical and conical shells of circular

  we consider in this report the
determination of the upper limit of
critical loads in the case of simultaneous
action of a compressive force,
uniformly distributed over plane cross
sections, and of isotropic external
normal pressure on cylindrical or
conical shells of circular cross
section .  as a starting point we use
the differential equations for neutral
equilibrium of conical shells (ref. 1)
which have been used for the
solution of the problem of stability of conical
shells under torsion and under
axial compression (ref. 2),. upon solution
of the problem it is possible
to satisfy all boundary conditions, in
contrast to the report (ref. 3)
where no attention is paid to the fulfillment
of the boundary conditions
and to the report (ref. 4) where only part
of the boundary conditions are
satisfied by solution of the problem
according to galerkin's method .
approximate formulas are used for the
determination of the critical
external normal pressure with simultaneous
action of longitudinal
compression .  let us note that the formulas
suggested in reference 5 are
not well founded and may lead, in a number
of cases, to a substantial
mistake in the magnitude of the critical load .

a donnell-type theory for asymmetrical bending and
buckling of thin conical shells .
  equations, somewhat more accurate than those recently
presented by n. j. hoff, are derived for bending and
buckling of thin circular conical shells under arbitrary loading .
these equations reduce to donnell's equations for thin
cylindrical shells when the cone semivertex angle becomes
very small and the minimum radius of curvature of the
median surface approaches a constant value .  at the
other end of the scale the equations reduce to the
well-known equations for flat circular plates when the cone
semivertex angle approaches a right angle .  in addition,
for the entire range of cone semivertex angles the
equations reduce to the known equations for axisymmetrical
bending when variations of the displacements around the
circumference vanish .  the problem of bending is
reduced to the solution of a single fourth-order partial
differential equation with variable coefficients .

on the buckling of truncated conical shells in torsion .
the problem of the buckling of thin circular
conical frustums in pure torsion is solved in
a manner similar to that employed previously
by the author for buckling under uniform
hydrostatic pressure .  synthesis of the numerical
results indicates that the critical torsion
of a truncated cone is equal to that of an
equivalent cylinder whose length and thickness
are the axial length and wall thickness of
the cone and whose radius is a function of the
semivertex angle and the taper ratio of the
cone .  curves and equations to aid in the
analysis of conical frustums are given .

the analysis of truncated cones in torsion
may be seriously unconservative in some cases .

in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamic
loading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it is
frequently assumed that there is no nose-tail interaction .  it is
the purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundary-layer
effects, this assumption is not warranted when the nose
hypersonic-similarity parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, or
greater .  physically speaking, the entropy change associated
with a strong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressure
down-stream of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure in
the vicinity of the tail .

exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward
facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach
number 6 free stream .
  the effect of a forward-facing jet on
the bow shock of a blunt body in a
mach 6 free stream was investigated
experimentally .  the models tested had
forward-facing jets using air and helium exhausting
at mach numbers from 1 to 10.3 and
were run through a range of the ratio of jet
total pressure to free-stream total
pressure of 0.03 (jet off) to 2.5 .  the ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit
diameter varied from 1.12 to 55.6 and the angle
of attack was varied from 0 to 35 .
  the experimental results show that the
main-stream shock can be affected by
the jet in two significantly different ways .
one way is simply to move the strong
shock away from the body without altering its
shape .  the second and perhaps more
interesting case occurs when the jet causes a
large displacement of the main shock
and considerably changes its shape .  it was
found that the ratio of jet total
pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary
to obtain the large displacements
of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit
diameter and also on the jet-exit mach number .  the
maximum amount the shock could be
displaced in percent of body diameter was seen
to increase with increasing
jet-exit mach number and also with decreasing ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit
diameter .  for the models that were investigated
through an angle-of-attack range, the
displacement became very unsteady and fell off
sharply as the angle of attack was
increased .
  simplified theoretical considerations applied
to the shock-displacement
phenomena provide a possible explanation for the
two different types of
main-stream shock displacement .  theoretical curves
show the regions where these types
of displacement would occur for different exit
mach numbers and pressure ratios
for a forward-facing jet in a mach 6 stream .

consisting of a short blunt 10 semivertex
angle cone with a flat base and also with
a conical afterbody having a
semi-vertex angle of 50 .  measurements were
made in helium at a free-stream mach
number of 15 and a free-stream reynolds
number of 2.25x10 based on maximum body
diameter over an angle-of-attack range from
  the configuration with the conical
afterbody was statically stable in the
nose-forward attitude only, whereas the
configuration with no afterbody was
statically stable in both the nose-forward
and base-forward attitudes .  the force
and moment data of both shapes were predicted
reasonably well by modified
newtonian theory at all angles of attack,
except the pitching-moment coefficient
for the model without afterbody near 180
angle of attack .  in this region,
measurements indicated static stability, whereas
theory indicated static instability .
the helium data agreed reasonably well with
a limited amount of force and moment
data obtained in a ballistic range at small
angles of attack in air at a mach
number of 15 and also with force and moment
data obtained in air over a complete
angle-of-attack range at a mach number of 5.5 .
the value of axial-force
coefficient and the shape of the bow shock wave at
zero angle of attack for both models

agreed very well with the data .
the value of the axial force coefficient at 180

with afterbody agreed reasonably well with the

boundaries were obtained for four of
the five distinct types of panels
which make up the vertical sides of
the stabilizers .  the boundaries
consisted of a flat-panel boundary
and a thermally buckled-panel
boundary .  the flat-panel boundaries were
characterized by a reduction in
dynamic pressure with increasing skin
temperature,. whereas, after thermal
buckling the trend was reversed .  the
minimum dynamic pressure for
flutter occurred at the intersection of
the flat-panel and buckled-panel
boundaries and represented a large
reduction in the dynamic pressure
over the extrapolated, unstressed value .
as a result of panel flutter,
three of the five distinct types of
panels were modified to provide the

  a general theory of creep buckling, with the initial
imperfection as a parameter, is developed for the case of normal loading .
a hyperbolic-sine law is used to describe the process of creep .  the
theory is believed to be applicable to, among other structures,
columns, tubes, and possibly conical shells .  the wall of the
structure is idealized as a sandwich in order to simplify the
integration of the equations .
  experimental data on columns and tubes, from two different
sources, are compared with the predictions of the theory .

contributions to the theory of heat transfer through
a laminar boundary layer .
an approximation to the heat transfer rate across a laminar
incompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of
main stream velocity and of wall temperature, is obtained by
using the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the
coefficients in a manner which is most closely correct near the
surface .  the heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l
breadth is given as
where k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number,
p its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction,
and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature .
a critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very
accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the
constant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed
this yields a formula for nusselt number in terms of the reynolds number
r and the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the
case of uniform wall temperature .
however, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the
original formula is accurate to within 3 percent even for .  by
known transformations an expression is deducted for heat
transfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution
along it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary
mach number (equation (42)) .  from this the temperature distribution
along such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach
numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation
from it .  this calculation, which includes the solution of a non-linear
integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose,
and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory
which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat
transfer balance .  this effect will be considerably mitigated
for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not
in a position to say whether or not it will be appreciable for
metal projectiles .  but for stony meteorites at a certain stage
of their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that
melting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for
which the shape and constitution of a few of them affords evidence .
an appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving
von mises's equation could be used to determine the skin friction
as well as heat transfer rate, but this line seems to have no advantage
over established approximate methods .

on fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, and
effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces .
an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,
and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several
limitations on such streams .
in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force
liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure
gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in
the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same
boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which
agrees closely with machine calculations .
in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due
 to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be
negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are
separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature
variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional
heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the
constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for
free-convection flows/ considered by many authors .
finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise
variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the
independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise
velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the
channel, a solution is given .

approximate analysis of thrust vector control by fluid injection .
a study has been made of the side force generated by injection of
secondary material into the main stream of a rocket nozzle . two cases
have been analyzed .. gas injection and liquid injection . for the gas
injection case, it is assumed that the turbulent boundary layer ahead of
 the injection point separates from the wall . the pressure in the
separated region and the extent of the separated region are determined
by a consideration of turbulent boundary layer-shock wave interaction
and the accommodation height of the injected gas stream . equations are
derived for calculating the side force, and the side forces predicted by
 the theory are compared with experimental data . the agreement between
theory and experiment is fair . for the case of liquid injection, it is
assumed that the liquid flows along the nozzle wall and evaporates into
the main stream . the resulting side force on the nozzle wall is
determined on the basis of linearized theory, thus restricting the analysis
to small rates of liquid injection . the effects of small rates of heat
addition are also included in the analysis . a very simple equation for

one dimensional flows of an imperfect diatomic gas .
  with the assumptions that berthelot's equation of state
accounts for molecular size and intermolecular force effects, and
that changes in the vibrational heat capacities are given by a
planck term, expressions are developed for analyzing
one-dimensional flows of a diatomic gas .
  the special cases of flow through normal and oblique shocks
in free air at sea level are investigated .  it is found that up to a
mach number of 10 the pressure ratio across a normal shock
differs by less than 6 percent from its ideal gas value,. whereas
at mach numbers above 4 the temperature rise is considerably
below and hence the density rise is well above that predicted
assuming ideal gas behavior .  it is further shown that only the
caloric imperfection in air has an appreciable effect on the
pressures developed in the shock process considered .  the effects
of gaseous imperfections on oblique shock flows are studied from
the standpoint of their influence on the lift and pressure drag
of a flat plate operating at mach numbers of 10 and 20 .  the
influence is found to be small .

turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body
at hypersonic speeds .
  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10
corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid
wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed
body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion
and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed
by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from
the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the
surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows
enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer
inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it
behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/
wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial
value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of
the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight
velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the
turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar
turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements
of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the
region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .
tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the
wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed
case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .
  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as
electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the
two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure
diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for
m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the
case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent
radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300
mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for
uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the
width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma
requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body
diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .
these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider
including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion
recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete
picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .

a steady two-dimensional motion
are solved for any given initial
velocity distribution (distribution along a
normal to the boundary wall,
downstream of which the motion is to be
calculated) .  this initial velocity
distribution is assumed expressible
as a polynomial in the distance from
the wall .  three cases are considered ..
first, when in the initial distribution
the velocity vanishes at the wall,
but its gradient along the normal
does not,. second, when the velocity in
the initial distribution does not
vanish at the wall,. and third, when both
the velocity and its normal gradient
vanish at the wall (as at a point
where the forward flow separates
from the boundary) .  the solution is
found as a power series in some
fractional power of the distance along
the wall, whose coefficients are
functions of the distance from the wall to
be found from ordinary differential
equations .  some progress is made
in the numerical calculation of
these coefficients, especially in the first
case .  the main object was to
find means for a step-by-step calculation
of the velocity field in a boundary
layer, and it is thought that such a
procedure may possibly be successful
even if laborious .  the same
mathematical method is used to calculate
the flow behind a flat plate along a
stream .  the results are shown in
curves in the original .

correlation of base pressure and wake structure of

it has been established in the past that there is a certain
relationship between base pressure and boundary-layer
behavior .  the base-pressure and wake-flow conditions were
found to be dependent upon the local flow characteristics at the
surface of supersonic vehicles directly upstream of the base or of
the region of wake-flow separation .
  in order to use existing data on cones and other shapes to
predict wake angle and base pressure on blunt bodies, an attempt was
made recently at the naval ordnance laboratory to establish
a unique relationship between given local flow conditions at the

and the corresponding wake-flow conditions with zero heat

a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from
arbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat-transfer
coefficient .
a method of calculating the temperature of thick walls has been
developed in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the time
series and the response to a unit triangle variation of surface
temperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transient
temperature and heat flow into thick walls . the method can be used
without knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development . the
method is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in
one-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is a
continuous variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-wall
temperature . the method also offers a convenient means for solving the
inverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperature
history is known .
a series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well
as by the new method . a comparison of the results shows the new
method to be accurate . the labor involved is very modest in
consideration of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problem .
limiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls so
thin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained .

the temperature history in a thick skin subjected to laminar heating
during entry into the atmosphere .
during high speed entry into the earth's atmosphere, a vehicle can be
afforded thermal protection for the short period of entry heating by a
thick outer skin, sometimes called a /heat sink/ . the temperature
distribution in such a heat sink has been found by integrating the
product of the laminar aerodynamic heating rate and the appropriate
green's function for a finite-thickness wall over the generalized
trajectory for a vehicle entering the earth's atmosphere at high speeds
dimensional heat conduction problem for laminar heating . the maximum
surface temperature that occurs during the generalized entry trajectory
for any combination of wall thickness and thermal properties is obtained
from which the performance of any material can be found, provided that
the average thermal properties may be used . as an example of the use of
 the solution, the performance of copper, graphite, molybdenum and

symmetry was assumed, but the forces in the meridional /hub to shroud/
plane, which are derived from tangential pressure gradients, were taken
into account .
the method was applied to an experimental mixed-flow impeller . the
analysis of the flow in the meridional plane of the impeller showed that
 the rotational forces, the blade curvature, and the hub-shroud profile

design and test of mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison of
experimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapid
approximate method .
three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and
skewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure
 to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet .
all original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained .
experimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had better
performance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds
investigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per
second and higher . these large gains probably resulted primarily from
more favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers
further away from the condition necessary for eddy formation . the
modified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range of
weight flows at high speeds .
the modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalent
speeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the
 point of incipient surge . at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure
ratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the
parabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively . for the same
conditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed
 impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737
 and 0.805, respectively . of the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller
had the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best
weight-flow range over the speed range tested . on the basis of the
parameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior
to circular blading . the experimental results indicate that the design
method of naca tn 3399 is a reliable method for use in designing
centrifugal impellers .

a general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonic
turbo-machines of axial-radial-and mixed-flow types .
a general theory of steady three-dimensional flow of a nonviscous fluid
in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub and casing
 shapes and a finite number of blades is presented . the solution of the
 three-dimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained by
investigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaces
whose intersections with a z-plane either upstream of or somewhere
inside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial line . the equations
obtained to describe the fluid flow on these stream surfaces show
clearly the several approximations involved in ordinary two-dimensional
treatments . they also lead to a solution of the three-dimensional
problem in a mathematically two-dimensional manner through iteration .
the equation of continuity is combined with the equation of motion in
either the tangential or the radial direction through the use of a
stream function defined on the surface, and the resulting equation is
chosen as the principal equation for such flows . the character of this
equation depends on the relative magnitude of the local velocity of
sound and a certain combination of velocity components of the fluid . a
general method to solve this equation by both hand and high-speed
digital machine computations when the equation is elliptic or hyperbolic
 is described . the theory is applicable to both irrotational and
rotational absolute flow at the inlet of the blade row and at both design
and off-design operations .

incompressible nonviscous blade-to-blade flow through a pump rotor with

the nonviscous flow through a mixed-flow pump impeller having one
splitter vane between adjacent main blades has been analyzed on a
blade-to-blade surface of revolution using a previously reported
analysis method . solutions were obtained for a variety of flow
conditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to the
flow upstream of the impeller .
the velocity distributions on the main-blade surfaces and on the
splitter-vane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were strongly
dependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation points .
solutions were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of
 flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of the
rear stagnation points . these solutions indicated that the velocity
distributions in the splitter-vane region are largely determined by the
division of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region in
the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slip
factor .
blade surface velocities were obtained from two approximate methods by
specifying flow division and slip factor, and these results are compared
 with the more exact solutions of the analysis .

a rapid approximate method for determining velocity distribution on
impeller blades of centrifugal compressors .
a rapid approximate method of analysis was developed for both
compressible and incompressible, nonviscous flow through radial- or
mixed-flow centrifugal compressors with arbitrary hub and shroud contours and
with arbitrary blade shape . the method of analysis is used to determine
 approximately the velocities everywhere along the blade surfaces, but
no information concerning the variation in velocity across the passage
between blades is given .
in eight numerical examples for two-dimensional flow, covering a fairly
wide range of flow rate, impeller-tip speed, number of blades, and blade
 curvature, the velocity distribution along the blade surfaces was
obtained by the approximate method of analysis and compared with the
velocities obtained by relaxation methods . in all cases the agreement
between the approximate solutions and the relaxation solutions was
satisfactory except at the impeller tip where the velocities obtained by
 the approximate method did not, in general, become equal on both
surfaces of the blade as required by the joukowski condition .

wing-flow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed by
projecting a jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid of fineness
ratio 6 .
a study was made at transonic speeds by the naca wing-flow method of the
 pressure-drag reduction obtained by projecting a high-energy jet of air
 from the nose of a prolate spheroid . supplementary information was
obtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted in a small
supersonic tunnel at a constant mach number of 1.5 .
the high-velocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distribution
over the body in such a way that the pressure drag of the body was
reduced,. thus, in a restricted sense, the nose jet produced a thrust on
 the body . under the conditions investigated, the thrust produced by
the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected from a
conventional rearward jet . for example, under the best conditions
tested /mach number of 1.07/ the reduction in body pressure drag caused
by the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet
 itself . however, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in
 body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust of
the jet/ was only about one-half of the thrust which would be produced
by the same jet exhausting rearward . the appearance of such an
unexpectedly large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to be
worth further study .

the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of a body
of revolution in supersonic flow .
an investigation has been made at a mach number of 1.62 to determine
the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of an
elliptical body of revolution upon boundary-layer transition and the
viscous, pressure, and total drag of the forebody at three body stations
body nose were also obtained . the tests were conducted at reynolds
numbers of 2.13 x 10 and 7.66 x 10, based on body length . the maximum
range of thrust coefficients for the small jet was from 0 to about
at the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer was
laminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition, a very small flow
 from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of
the 20-percent-body station . as the jet flow was increased, the
transition point moved abruptly to the nose at a thrust coefficient of about
gardless of the type of boundary layer . at the higher test reynolds
number for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet-off
 condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat
 by the action of the jet .
although the forward-exhausting small jet was found to have the above
favorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed too
important since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small
 jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional manner .
no attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the present
investigation, yet, from a general consideration of the benefits
indicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the
vicinity of rearward-exhausting jets, the benefits of a small jet
exhausting rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet
exhausting forward, particularly so when the flow over the body is
laminar in the jet-off condition .

mach number, and ratio of jet-exit diameter to body diameter had large
influences on the body pressures on the windward halves of the

negligible effect of reynolds number on the body pressures . the ratio

the pressure distribution and pressure drag of a blunt body with a
supersonic jet issuing upstream from its center were determined at
free-stream mach numbers of 1.60, 2.00, and 2.85 . the thrust of the jet
 issuing from the model nose was varied to study its effects on flow
around the model and to determine variation of pressure distribution and
 pressure drag of the model with the thrust .
at all mach numbers investigated, the pressure drag decreased with
increasing retrorocket thrust until a minimum value was reached .
further increases in retrorocket thrust resulted in increases in the
pressure drag . the resultant drag /pressure drag plus retrorocket
thrust but excluding base and skin-friction drag/ of the model was
reduced by retrorocket operation below the drag for a jet-off condition,
 except at very low retrorocket thrust coefficients . the flow about the
 nose of the blunt body was very unstable throughout the range of mach
numbers and retrorocket thrust coefficients investigated .

extension of boundary layer separation criteria to

  an experimental investigation has
been made of the separation
phenomena on a flat plate to which
forward-facing steps were attached to
force separation .  both laminar and
turbulent flows were investigated
over a mach number range of approximately
distributions, shadowgraph and chemical
film techniques, the pressure
rise at separation, the laminar plateau
pressure, and the turbulent
peak pressure were determined .
boundary-layer surveys were made on a
smooth flat plate and on a flat plate with
roughness to force
transition .  examinations of the separated flow
showed that the predominant
variable in the determination of the pressure
distribution was the
location of transition relative to the separation
point and reattachment .
pure laminar, transitional, and turbulent
types of separation were found
in this mach number range .  the peak
static-pressure-rise ratios for
identical forward-facing steps at a mach
number of 6.25 were
approximately 1.5 and 5.0, respectively, for pure
laminar and turbulent
separation .  the effect of reynolds number on the
peak pressure rise for
turbulent separation for the lower mach number
range was found to be very
minor provided the step height was of the
order of the boundary-layer
thickness .  as the mach number is increased,
the peak pressure
coefficient for turbulent separation decreased
from approximately 0.18
at a mach number of 4 to about 0.13 at a mach
number of 6.25 .  the
pressure coefficient at the separation point for
laminar separation decreases
from approximately 0.014 at a mach number of
value at a mach number of 6.5 .  the results
obtained with forward-facing
steps agree with the trends predicted, based

half-angle base cone .  reynolds numbers
for the test ranged from about

  variations in the base cone angle
resulted in significant changes in

lesser effects resulting from changes
in nose cone angle .  in particular,
the model with the 50 half-angle
conical base had only one trim angle
flat base and 70 half-angle conical

of 90,000 and 220,000, respectively .  it
was found that the models were
statically stable about the center-
of-gravity location tested but
exhibited neutral dynamic stability for flight
at constant altitude .  the
static stability was not affected by the
but was nonlinear with angle of attack
and varied with mach number .  the
nonlinear variation of the pitching moment
with angle of attack was
accurately approximated by a cubic polynomial .
the static stability was only
qualitatively predicted by modified newtonian
theory .  the drag
characteristics were in good agreement with values
calculated by use of modified
newtonian theory .
  calculations of the oscillatory
behavior of the configurations flying
an example entry trajectory through
the martian atmosphere indicated the
configurations to be dynamically
satisfactory .  pitching motions should
converge to a small fraction of the
amplitude at entry, provided the
initial angle of attack and pitch
rate are not large enough to cause
tumbling .

the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a blunted 10degree
semivertex angle cone were studied . the cone which had a modified
spherical segment nose was tested with a flat base and with a truncated
conical base .
all tests were performed in air at mach numbers from 0.65 to 2.20 with
the angle-of-attack range from -4degree to +18degree . presented are
measurements of the normal force, axial force, base pressure, and
pitching moment from the static tests, and the damping-in-pitch moment
from the dynamic tests .
both models had satisfactory stability characteristics throughout the
test mach number range but the addition of the conical afterbody had a

preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds .
generally accepted solutions for the problems of hypersonic flight
appear, at the moment, to be centered around the use of blunt bodies to
minimize the heat-transfer rates . there are, however, several other
solutions to the problem, and, as part of an exploratory study of these
solutions, a detailed examination has been made of the flow over blunt
bodies equipped with a spike . these tests, carried out at a mach number
 of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel, have
investigated the effect of varying spike lengths for flat-faced and
hemispherically-nosed axially symmetric bodies . detailed pressure distributions
have been obtained as well as heat-transfer rates .
these exploratory studies have shown that the use of a spike protruding
from a hemispherical-nosed cylinder at m 14 decreased the pressure
level by an order of magnitude and the heat transfer to a fraction of
that measured on a hemisphere without a spike . the general technique
appears to hold considerable promise for hypersonic flight .

these calculations are presented in the form of simple correction
factors which must be applied to the tabulated ideal-gas parameters .  it
has been shown that the deviations from the ideal-gas law which exist
at high pressures may cause a corresponding significant error in the

example, the ratio of the free-stream static to stagnation pressure as
calculated from the thermodynamic properties of helium for a stagnation

  the effects of contamination of helium by air upon static-pressure,

investigated in the 2-inch helium tunnel at the langley research
center .  within the scope of the tests, even a small amount of air is
shown to affect these measurements .  the heat-transfer and temperature
measurements were made on a 26.6 half-angle cone and demonstrated the
effects of contamination qualitatively .  the wall static and
center-line pitot pressures show that if the contaminating air is held to less
than about 0.2 percent by volume, the error in indicated mach number is
less than 1 percent as calculated from the rayleigh pitot equation .
the corresponding errors in wall static and center-line pitot pressures
are about 1.7 and 0.4 percent, respectively .

charts which enable the determination of the aerodynamic forces and
moments acting on arbitrary bodies of revolution undergoing either
separate or combined angle-of-attack and pitching motions .  bodies with
axially increasing and decreasing cross-sectional area distributions are
considered,. nose shapes may be sharp, blunt, or flat faced .  the
analysis considers variations in angle of attack from -90 to 90 and
allows for both positive and negative pitching rates of arbitrary

  the possibility of a gradual instability
failure of a column under
compressive load has been recognized
for some time .  marin presented an
analysis of creep buckling based on
a theory of creep bending, but did not
take into account the average stress
due to axial loading .  the theory also
neglected the transient (nonlinear)
portion of the creep curve .
  in efficient column design, the
average stress should be relatively high in
comparison with the bending stresses,.
that is, the column should be as straight
as possible and the slenderness ratio
should not be too great .  under these
conditions marin's theory is not
directly applicable, although it gives good
agreement with tests of columns
having large slenderness ratios or large
eccentricities .

  published work on creep buckling has implied that failure
of columns after a critical time is caused by initial imperfections .
such analyses are relatively complex and ultimately leave the
choice of selecting the proper value of the initial imperfection to
the designer .  furthermore, recent test results on creep buckling
of columns have indicated that there is a random and relatively
unimportant effect of small initial imperfections on the critical
time .
  to avoid the difficulties associated with initial imperfections,
a formulation of the creep buckling phenomenon in terms of
classical stability theory is presented .  the theory permits the
extension of known solutions for plastic buckling of certain thin
plates and shells to creep buckling problems .

  the determination of column deflections and
column buckling loads has been considered for
many years .  the available theories, however,
do not provide for materials which creep with
time under constant loads .  for the design of
structural members made of these materials, a
consideration of creep may be of practical
importance .  plastics, concrete, and some metals
creep at normal temperatures while other
metals creep only at high temperatures and at stress
values beyond the yield point .  a consideration
of creep in the design of some structures appears
appropriate in view of the modern developments
in plastics and the presence of high stress values
which are sometimes beyond the yield stress .
this paper gives a rational theory for predicting
creep deflections in columns .  a special case
using this theory is applied to the interpretation of
some preliminary tests of an aluminum alloy .

note on creep buckling of columns .
it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for
the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial
imperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by
which failure due to creep occurs after a period of time .  in fact,
it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfect
column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical
load will not buckle at all .  this is an interesting contrast to the
case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an
insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect
column is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfect
column .  it is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there is
any possible mechanism by which a column containing no initial
imperfections can fail as a result of creep when the initial load is
less than the theoretical buckling load .

objective of obtaining procedures for predicting column lifetime .
semiempirical lifetime curves are obtained with the aid of a previously
published column creep theory and are used for deriving column curves .
the semiempirical lifetime curves are also used to study the effect of
varying applied stress and out-of-straightness .  in the range
considered, small variations in out-of-straightness are found to be of
little practical significance,. whereas, small stress variations change
the column lifetime considerably .  for the range of out-of-straightness
encountered in the tests, the data can be presented in plots that do not
explicitly include out-of-straightness, and plots of this type should be
satisfactory for predicting column lifetime for design purposes .

  a method for estimating allowable
load capacities of columns subject
to creep is presented .  the method,
which utilizes approximate stress
distributions derived from
isochronous-stress-strain curves to estimate
column load capacities, is shown to
be conservative for the time for which
the estimate is made .
  an application of the method is
made to test data on as-received and
on stabilized 24s-t4 aluminum alloy .
a comparison of the computed column
capacities with experimental capacities
indicates that the method is
satisfactory for estimating the decrease in
capacity with increasing time .
  easily obtained, time-dependent
tangent-modulus loads are discussed .
they are interpreted as being approximations
to allowable load-capacity
estimates .  a limited application is made to
test data, and the results
appear promising .  it is concluded that if
certain limitations are recognized,
the method may prove to be useful because
of its simplicity .
  a presentation of the results of an
experimental investigation of the
effects of column imperfection and
column-material variation is made .  it
is found that column-capacity variations of
the order of 10 per cent can
result from column-imperfection differences
and column-material variation .
  the results of an experimental study of
the variation of column
capacity with temperature of exposure are presented .
they indicate that column
efficiency, as measured by decrease in capacity,
can be acceptable for very
short times at the higher temperatures .  the
efficiency at these higher
temperatures falls rapidly, however, with increasing time .

  the general dynamic equation of
creep bending of a beam loaded
laterally and axially was derived for a
linearly viscoelastic material whose
mechanical properties can be characterized
by four parameters .  the
material can exhibit instantaneous and retarded
elasticity as well as pure
flow .
  the equation derived was used to
obtain the creep bending deflection
of a beam in pure bending and of a column
with initial sinusoidal
deviation from straightness .  as expected, the
ratio of the creep deflections
of the beam in pure bending and the
deflections of a corresponding purely
elastic structure is identical to the
ratio of the creep strain and the
corresponding elastic strain of a bar
under simple tension or compression .
  the results of the analysis of the
creep deflection of the column
showed that the deflections increase
continuously with time and become
infinitely large only when the loading
time is correspondingly large .
however, large deflections are obtained
in reasonably short periods of
time if the applied load is near to the
euler load of the column .  the
deflection-time curves obtained from a
numerical example are of the same
type as those determined by experiment
with aluminum columns .

  the creep of a slightly crooked section column carrying a
constant load is studied theoretically .  the material of the
column is characterized by a strain-time relationship, under
constant uniaxial stress, of the form, where is
the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b,
and k are material constants .  this form was selected because it
applies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f .
and a low-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f .  however, the
analysis is intended for any material having creep properties of the
same form and for which the material constants are known .  a
strain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary
for the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stress
properties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses of
creep .
  the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection
approaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite time .
results are given showing the maximum length of time the
column can support a given load before it collapses and the growth
of stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse .

behavior of polycrystalline metals
above the equicohesive temperature .
the properties of the metal
included in the relation are elasticity,
linear thermal expansion, and
viscosity .  the relation may be integrated
under various conditions to
provide information on creep rates, creep
rupture, stress-strain curves,
and rapid-heating curves .  it is shown

  the phenomenological theory previously
proposed in naca technical
note 4000 for the behavior of metals at
elevated temperatures has been
modified to yield transient creep curves
by assuming that the metal
consists of two phases, each with its own
elasticity and viscosity .  the
extended theory satisfies the basic
requirements for a theory of
transient creep at elevated temperatures ..
that the transient creep be closely
connected with the subsequent steady
creep, and that the apparent
exponent of the time in the transient region
be permitted wide variations
between 0 and 1 .  from this theory it is
possible to construct
nondimensional creep curves which extend continuously
from the transient region
into the steady-state region .  the
corresponding family of creep curves
for any metal may be obtained from
the nondimensional family by use of
appropriate constants .  the constants
required are those obtained from
steady creep measurements, together
with two additional constants which
represent the difference between the
phases .  the transient creep curves
resulting from this theory are compared
with the experimental curves
for pure aluminum, gamma iron, lead, and
agreement is found .

  a general variational theory of elastic stability that was
originated by e. trefftz (1) is applied to the problem of
buckling of rings of rectangular cross section subjected to
uniform external pressure .  the theory is believed to be
more rigorous than previous treatments of the problem,
since it avoids conventional assumptions of curved-beam
theory, such as the assumptions that plane sections
remain plane and that radial stresses vanish .  the classical
result of levy (2) is confirmed for a ring of infinitesimal
thickness .  new results are obtained which show the
effect of the finite thickness of a ring on the coefficients in
the buckling formula .

the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems in
instability problems is discussed in reference 1 .  it is shown that,
whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determination
of instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are valid
only for conservative and nongyroscopic systems .  small changes in
the character of the loading could make an otherwise conservative
system nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of the
buckling load .  the buckling load of the cantilever column example
in reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that for

the design of tubes under uniform external pressure on the
basis of assumed inaccuracies .
since the failure of tubes under uniform external pressure depends
very much upon the various kinds of imperfections in them,
it seems logical to derive a design formula for such tubes in
which the quantities depending on imperfections will appear explicitly .
the most common imperfection in tubes is an initial ellipticity,
the limiting value of which in each type of tube is usually well-known

  the stability of a compressed elastic
ring has been studied by a method which
can be extended to solve the problem
of the stability of a flexible heavy structure
spread by a system of hoops as in a crinoline
skirt .  the original work by levy, which
was developed by timoshenko and love,
cannot be generalized to problems in
which the compressing forces are affected by
the deformation of the ring .
  it is shown that the load at which a ring
will buckle depends not only upon the
magnitude of the load but also upon its first
derivative relative to the radial distance .
a positive derivative causes the ring to
buckle at a higher load .  when this result
is applied to a cone of heavy and loosely
draped fabric spread by a rigid hoop of
radius and a larger and flexible hoop
of radius below it, both hoops being in
horizontal planes, then various modes
of buckling other than oval are possible
according to the relative magnitudes of
and .  it is found that oval buckling
changes to three-wave buckling when
three-wave changes to
four-wave when, and as and
approach nearer to equality the buckled
form progressively changes to more waves .
when applied to a structure spread by
many horizontal hoops of which the top
one is rigid and oval, it is found that all
other hoops, if each is designed to the
criterion, will have the same
absolute deviation from circularity as the
rigid hoop .  if any one hoop is designed
so that, then the oval shape of
the rigid hoop is magnified on all flexible
hoops .

  according to marguerre (proc. 5th internat. congress
appl. mech., cambridge, mass., 1938, wiley, new york,
shells are governed by three simultaneous differential
equations in the three displacements .  the author has
considerably simplified this theory for the case of transverse
vibrations by ignoring the longitudinal inertia terms, thus
reducing the problem to that of solving two simultaneous
differential equations in a stress function and one
displacement component .  this simplification is justified by an
order-of-magnitude analysis, and illustrated by considering the
vibrations of a paraboloidal shell with a rectangular
boundary .

  an experimental investigation was
made (1) to evaluate previously
published theoretical procedures for
the prediction of stress
distribution for cases of radially symmetric
abrupt change in wall thickness of
thin-walled cylinders subject to
internal pressure and (2) to
investigate the significance of stresses
attributable to the presence of
thickness changes typical of design practice .
one theory was adequate in
itself for solution of the case of continuous
middle surface,. use of the
second theoretical procedure was required
to determine the additional
stresses arising from discontinuous middle
surfaces at the change in
thickness .
  comparisons were made between
theoretical and experimental stress
distributions for cases with continuous
middle and continuous inner
surfaces for radially symmetric changes in
wall thickness of a cylinder
subject to internal pressure for diameter
to larger wall thickness ratios
of 117 and 28 and for the case of a
continuous outer surface for a ratio
of 28 .  in all tests the ratio of wall
thicknesses at the change in wall
thickness was 0.4 .
  there was reasonably good correlation
between theoretical and
experimental curves of stress distribution .
on the basis of this
correlation, it was concluded that the applicable
theories were valid .  it
was shown that inclusion of the stresses
arising from the condition of
discontinuous middle surfaces at a change
in thickness has an important
effect on stress distribution .
  in the case of a cylinder with a
continuous outer surface, the
maximum mean effective stress was of sufficient
magnitude to indicate that
this geometry should be avoided in design
if possible .  the maximum
mean effective stress was not increased to
a significant degree by the
presence of a change in wall thickness in
the other cases .

  experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer
rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully
separated wakes are presented .  the afterbodies are generally
similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end
of the forebody .
  tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a
range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical
flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering
models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft.
altitude .  stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to
  strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows
which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or
slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a
short distance and then connects with the afterbody .  judiciously
interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat
wider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are
presented and compared with each other in terms of
nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the
forebody .
  the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be
roughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody,
the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody
end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or
reynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds
number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained
from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and
some quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number
range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit
boundary layers were considered to be laminar .  an approximate
check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present
tests also indicates a laminar rate .  no information was obtained
concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated
boundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient
on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was
observed .
  heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an
afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise
direction is noted .  the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies
with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end)
roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) .
  heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost
twice the values on the sides .  the heat rates on the large-step
body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .
  in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion
angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing
test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach
number square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the
effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually
constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody
heat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the
afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the
stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on
this body .

the love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been applied
to cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stress
resultants were given in terms of kelvin's functions . since
tabulation of these functions for large arguments is not practical,
considerable computation was still required .  in the present paper, the authors
define special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluating
kelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic and
trigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacements
for cones for various loading conditions .  these special functions also

  a numerical analysis is given for the solution of the
general equations of thin shells of revolution subjected to
rotationally symmetric pressure and temperature
distributions .
  the basic differential equations are in a very general
form, which permits the geometry of the shells considered,
to be specified by discrete data points .
  the analysis determines elastic stresses, strains and
displacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells of
revolution .  surface loads, temperatures, thicknesses and
material properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridional
direction .  temperatures and material properties can also
vary through the thickness .
  the solution is obtained by direct computation using a
numerical method that employs two by two coefficient
matrices,. and hence avoids the problems of slow convergence .
the solution has been programmed in a semi-algebraic
language which can be used on most high speed computers .
comparisons of numerical solutions to known exact and
approximate solutions of the thin shell equations are made to
demonstrate the accuracy of this method .

be advantageous .  two cases of shallow shells give
particularly simple solutions ..  parabolic shells of nth degree and
uniform thickness, and parabolic shells of mth degree with
thickness varying as mth power of the distance from the

be described here is attributed to the russian
investigator v. g. galerkin, whose original papers are
inaccessible to the present writer .  his knowledge
of the method is derived from a description given in
a paper by e. p. grossman .  grossman states
that the method was given by galerkin in his treatise
p. 897), and that applications to oscillation problems
were first made by v. p. lyskov .  it is pointed
out by grossman that galerkin's process in applications
to mechanics leads to the same results as
lagrange's principle of virtual work, but employs a
special co-ordinate system .
  the method of galerkin belongs to the same general
class as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeks
to obtain an approximate solution of a differential
equation with given boundary conditions by taking
a function which satisfies these conditions exactly,
and proceeds to specialise the function in such a
manner as to secure approximate satisfaction of the
differential equation .  the selected function is
a linear combination of n independent functions, and
the coefficients are determined by a process of
integration .
  the galerkin process can be considered from two
points of view, (a) simply as a means for the
approximate solution of differential equations, and
treatment of problems concerning the statics and
dynamics of elastic and other deformable bodies .
these two aspects are treated separately in parts 1
and 2 of the paper respectively, and will now
be briefly discussed .
which satisfies the boundary conditions, in
the differential equation be .  since the result should be
zero, is the error in the differential equation .
then the galerkin process consists in choosing the n
coefficients in the function in such a manner that
n distinct weighted means of the error, taken throughout
a certain range of representation, shall all
be zero .
as a generalised force, and the multipliers used
to weight the errors are the virtual displacements
corresponding to increments of each of the generalised
co-ordinates in turn .  thus the vanishing of the
weighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishing
of the virtual work in the appropriate displacement .
  the degree of accuracy attaindd can be increased
indefinitely by increasing the number of
independent functions employed, but this entails a great
increase of labour .  however, when the functions
are well chosen, an excellent approximation can be
obtained by the use of a very small number, as is
sufficiently shown by the examples included in this paper .

  in the design of high-speed aircraft the importance of
unpressurized and pressurized monocoque cylinders necessitates a
reliable analysis procedure for the compressive buckling of
cylindrical shells .  analysis by the classical small-deflection theory has
proved inadequate .  recent large-deflection theoretical
treatments of the problem have shown reasonable correlation with
experiments but require a prior knowledge of the initial
imperfections of the cylinder .  developed in this paper is a
semiempirical procedure which permits a compressive buckling analysis of
cylindrical shells with a knowledge of the cylinder geometry only .
this analysis is achieved by correlating experimental data
statistically with theoretical parameters .
  in order to provide data not previously available, an extensive
series of axial compression tests of pressurized cylinders has been
performed .  these data, together with all other known test data,
are analyzed semiempirically .  in the analysis best-fit curves
are presented using theoretical parameters and shapes of curves
where applicable .  unpressurized and pressurized cylinder
compressive buckling curves are then developed as 90 per cent
probability curves from the test data .  in general, these
statistically defined design curves are significantly lower than
previously available design curves .

the nonlinear conical spring .
  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most
applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several
approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of
these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the
assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .
another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the
shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .
recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .
numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these
conditions of load have also been obtained (4) .  an examination
of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending
stresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the
meridional bending moment .

turbulent mixing of a rocket exhaust jet with a supersonic stream
including chemical reactions .
the equations for the turbulent mixing of a two-dimensional supersonic
jet issuing into an ambient supersonic stream are formulated . both
streams consist of a mixture of chemically active and possibly reacting
gases, therefore any heat release by chemical reaction is included,. the
 net mass rate of production of species is obtained on the assumption
that the reaction rate constant is given by an expression reducible to
the classical arrhenius law . the equations first given in terms of the
x, and y coordinates, are expressed in dimensionless form and in terms
of the x and coordinates, where is the stream function . the resulting
expressions are all of the /heat conduction/ type,. they are put in a
finite difference form by using the crank-nicolson method of
substituting finite difference approximations for both the /time/ and /space/
derivatives . the mixture is assumed to consist of six species, namely
h2o, h2, o2, co2, co, and n2, and the oxidation of h2 and co is assumed
to take place according to a single-step chemical reaction . the
solution of the problem is based on the simultaneous solution of 8n linear
algebraic equations in 8n unknowns, n being the number of internal grid
points at every step in the x-direction, and 8 the total number of
unknowns at each grid point, namely velocity, temperature, and
concentration for each of the six species . a method of obtaining initial and
boundary conditions from available inviscid jet flow solutions is
discussed . the equations are programed for calculation on an ibm-704
computer . finally, one typical case is considered, and plots of velocity,
temperature, and concentration profiles are given for the initial stages
 of development of the mixing layer .

  during static-thrust tests of a

static-pressure measurements were made on

survey the effects of the slipstream .  for
the conditions of highest slipstream energy,
the hovering end point of aerodynamic
parameters for aircraft having vertical and
short take-off and landing capability
the tilt-wing configuration (zero
flap deflection) was a 6 spanwise variation
in effective angle of attack in a
span of slightly less than 1 propeller diameter .
effective changes in camber
on the tilt-wing configuration as a result of
slipstream rotation, the radial
velocity gradient, and the resultant spanwise
flow were negative and had a maximum
magnitude of less than 2-percent chord .  for
the deflected-slipstream
configuration (double-slotted flaps deflected), effects
important to the hovering
performance were found, including a 40-percent spanwise
variation in effective thrust
recovery and a 20 spanwise variation in effective

wind tunnel measurements of aerodynamic damping derivatives
of a launch vehicle vibrating in free-free bending
modes at mach numbers from 0. 70 to 2. 87 and comparisons
with theory .
  the aerodynamic damping of a
flexibly mounted aeroelastic model
with a blunted conical nose and a
cylindrical afterbody was measured at
mach numbers from 0.70 to 1.20 at
several levels of dynamic pressure
and two weight conditions and at
mach numbers from 1.76 to 2.87 at one
weight condition .  the first two
free-free flexible modes of vibration
were investigated .  also investigated
at mach numbers from 0.9 to 1.2
was the aerodynamic damping in the
first free-free modes of a model
which had a /hammerhead/ nose (the
base diameter of the blunted cone
was greater than the diameter of the
afterbody which necessitated a
reflex angle downstream from the cone
base) .
  two basically different methods,
the /electrical power-input/ and
the /decaying oscillations/ methods were
used to determine the damping
and frequencies .  the experimentally
determined values are compared with
some applicable theories .  the results
of the investigation indicate
that the aerodynamic damping in the
elastic modes of vibration was small
for all configurations tested .  the
maximum aerodynamic damping measured
in the first mode was on the order of
damping .  the aerodynamic damping was
found to be even less for vibration
modes higher than the first .
reduced-frequency effects were found to be
negligible for the range investigated .
agreement of calculated
aerodynamic damping derivatives with the
experimental results was not good .
generally, the experimentally determined
derivatives were larger than
those predicted by the various theories
used .  the bond-packard theory
appeared to give the best agreement for
the first free-free vibration
mode but gave the worst agreement for the
second mode .  measurements
made on the configuration that had a
hammerhead nose indicated small
negative aerodynamic damping in the mach
number range from 0.95 to 1.00 .
aerodynamic stiffness effects were found
to be small and within the
experimental scatter .  (wind-on frequency
determination was accurate
only to approximately 1 percent .)

ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .
  the analytic investigation of laminar combustion
processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional
present some mathematical difficulties .  there are,
however, several examples of two-dimensional flame
propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in
comparison with that in the principal direction of flow .
such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching
by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate,
combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases
the problem may be simplified by employing what is
known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer
approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his
treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it
consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is
small, the variations of flow properties along the direction
of main flow are small in comparison with those in a
direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic
description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present
analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the
laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas
streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible
mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two
streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar
mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is
modified by viscosity, and the temperature and
composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical
reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream
is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with
temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law .
for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature
distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does
the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far
downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear
and what is the detailed process of development .  since
the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition
always takes place at some point of the stream .  however,
when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a
certain value, the distance required for ignition increases
so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a
physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete
development of the laminar flame front is computed using
an approximation similar to the integral technique
introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .

approximate second-order solutions for the supersonic flow around
wing-body combinations are calculated, using two different theoretical models
small and the wing sweep small in comparison with that of the mach cone
are considered . the analysis is restricted to such high mach numbers
that m-2 1, and an approximate formula common to the two models is then
found for the second-order interference term . this formula can also be
used to correct experimental pressure distributions for the effect of
nonuniformities in the wind-tunnel flow .
in order to test the theory, wind-tunnel experiments on non-lifting
cone-cylinder bodies in combination with wings of simple shapes were
performed . pressure distributions were measured at m 3 and m 4, both
around the bodies and on the wings separately, as well as in
combination, and it was found that the second-order interference was
predicted reasonably well by the simplified theory .

pressure distributions on the wing of two wing-body combinations are

with theoretical results which include interference effects calculated
according to the second-order supersonic wing-body interference theory
due to landahl and beane /1/ . this theory, having been tested
previously for non-lifting wing-body combinations, is thus tested also for
wings at incidence . the agreement between theory and experiment is
found to vary with mach number and wing sweepback . for the higher mach
number and moderate sweepback the theory gives a good prediction of
pressure distribution, but for the most adverse condition of low mach
number and large sweepback the theory is found to overestimate the
interference effects . this is expected as the theory assumes the
sweepback of the wings is small compared with that of the mach line . an
 empirical guide to the limit of application of the interference theory
is given . within this limit the agreement between theory and experiment
 is found to deteriorate only a little with increase of incidence, over

in this report numerical methods used to solve the navier-stokes
equations for steady viscous two-dimensional flow are extended to include
the case of axial symmetry . the equations and their finite difference
approximations are derived working in cylindrical polar co-ordinates
with the stokes' stream function and the vorticity as variables . a new
method of dealing with the boundary conditions is given .
the effects of viscosity and orlfice size on a blunt-nosed pitot tube
have been theoretically investigated up to a reynolds number of ten,
where the reynolds number has been based on the radius of the tube .
results are expressed in terms of a pressure coefficient where p is the
pressure measured in the tube, p the density of the fluid, and p  and u
the static pressure and velocity in an undisturbed flow at the position
of the tube .
the values of c for a blunt-nosed tube are found to be less than those
for tubes with hemispheroidal heads, but always greater than unity in
the range considered . the effect of the orifice size is to decrease c
as the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases
 with the reynolds number . at a reynolds number of ten the decrease is
at most five per cent of the value of c when there is no orifice .
it is suggested that the decrease of c below unity found in some
experimental investigations at a higher reynolds number could be due to the
effects of orifice size .

convergence rates of iterative treatments of partial differential
equations .
the development of high-speed digital computers has made feasible the
numerical solution by iterative methods of some partial differential
equations . the convergence rates of several such iterative methods are
estimated here . it is found that with the familiar elementary iterative
 methods some quite simple problems require prohibitive computational
labor .
the iterative methods here considered are related to the various forms
of the southwell /relaxation method/ in that they involve successively
applied local corrections to improve an approximate solution . however,
these iterative methods are routinized in conformity with the
requirements of automatic computers while the relaxation method is flexible and
 depends in an essential way on the skill of its practitioners .

aerodynamic characteristics of propeller-driven vtol
aircraft .
  this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usually
considered for achieving vtol while keeping the fuselage essentially
horizontal - that is, the tilt-wing and the deflected-slipstream
configurations .
  because of the high turning losses incurred by deflected-slipstream
configurations in hovering and because of the wing-stalling problem of
the pure tilt-wing configurations during the transition, it appears that
a combination of the two principles should be used .  this tilt-wing and
flap configuration should make use of a programed extensible-chord
slotted flap together with a leading-edge high-lift device in order to
avoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated with
wing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as low
as possible for efficiency in cruising flight .

wing-nacelle-propeller interference for wings of various

  an experimental investigation was made in the
n. a. c. a. full-scale wind tunnel to determine the effect
of wing span on nacelle-propeller characteristics and,
reciprocally, the lateral extent of nacelle and propeller
influence on a monoplane wing .  the results provide a
check on the validity of the previous research on nacelles
and propellers with 15-foot-span wings tested in the
  the scale propeller and the n. a. c. a. cowling
used in the former researches were tested in three typical
tractor locations with respect to a thick wing of 5-foot
chord and 30-foot span .  the span was progressively
reduced to 25,20, and 15 feet and the same characteristics
were measured in each case .
  the efficiency factors--propulsive efficiency, nacelle
drag efficiency, and net efficiency--were obtained for each
wing length by means of force tests and the values are
compared to determine the effect of span .
pressure-distribution measurements show the lateral extent of the
nacelle interference and the propeller-slipstream effect
on the span loading for the various conditions .  complete
polar curves and curves showing the variation of nacelle
drag with lift coefficient are also included .
  force and pressure-distribution tests concur in
indicating that, for engineering purposes, the influence of a
nacelle and of a propeller, in a usual combination, may
be considered to extend laterally on a wing the same
maximum distance, or about five nacelle diameters or two
propeller diameters outboard of their common axes .  all
important effects of scale nacelle-propeller
combinations may be measured within practical limits of accuracy
by tests of a 15-foot-span wing .

induced interference effects on jet and buried-fan
vtol configurations in transition .
  recent investigations of some jet and buried-fan configurations
have indicated that in the transition speed range, configurations with
considerable area surrounding the jet or buried fan can encounter large
losses in lift and nose-up pitching moments due to the pressures induced
on the lower surfaces by the interaction of the jet and free-stream
flow .  the obvious way of minimizing these effects is to reduce the
surface area surrounding the jets or buried fans, that is, to consider
these effects in the preliminary stages of the airplane design .

  an investigation of the effects
of ground proximity and propeller
position on the effectiveness of a
wing equipped with large-chord slotted
flaps in redirecting the slipstreams
from large-diameter propellers
downward for vertical take-off has been
conducted in a static-thrust
facility at the langley aeronautical
laboratory .
  the results indicate that, with
the propeller thrust axis on the
wing chord plane, both the angle through
which the slipstream is
deflected and the ratio of resultant force
to thrust are reduced as the ground
is approached .  at positions nearest
the ground some of the loss in
resultant force is regained .  lowering
the thrust axis below the wing
chord plane reduces the adverse effects
of the ground and also reduces
the large diving moments associated with
the slotted-flap arrangement .
the static-thrust efficiency of the
propellers is slightly reduced by
the ground effect .

has been conducted in the facilities

  under conditions of static thrust
and with zero incidence between the
thrust axis and the wing chord plane,
the slotted flaps were effective in
rotating the thrust vector upward about
than 10 percent of the thrust .  when an
auxiliary vane was added above the
wing, the thrust vector was rotated upward
configuration, vertical take-off
could be achieved with an initial attitude
of 16 and at airplane weights
up to 90 percent of the total propeller
thrust .  the addition of 10

increased the upward rotation

  this paper presents the results
of an experimental investigation on
the ablation of a number of promising
materials for heating conditions
comparable to those which may be
encountered by unmanned reentry
satellite vehicles, as well as for higher
heating conditions comparable to
those associated with reentry ballistic
missiles .  materials tested
included the plastics teflon, nylon,
and lucite,. the inorganic salts
ammonium chloride and sodium carbonate,.
graphite,. a phenolic resin and
fiber glass composition,. and the
commercial material haveg rocketon .
results of these tests indicated
heat-absorption capabilities which are
several times greater than those of
current metallic heat-sink materials .
the results with teflon showed that
for hemispherical noses there was no
apparent effect of size or
stagnation-point pressure on ablation rate
for the range of variables covered in
the tests .  for flat-faced
configurations, however, there was a definite
increase in the ablation rate with
increased stagnation-point pressure .
the results for the several
materials tested at heating rates
associated with reentry ballistic
missiles showed considerable increase
in the effective heats of ablation
over the results obtained at lower
heating rates .  this trend of
increased effectiveness with increased
heating potential is in
agreement with the predictions of ablation
theories .  comparisons of the
results for several materials tested
at the higher heating rates showed
graphite to have the lowest ablation
rate of all materials tested .

aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 .
results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamic
heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . data
obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced
cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the
hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range . tests made at a
mach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments
 of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature
can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders
with only a slight increase in the stagnation rate . the total heat
transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than
the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders .
comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions
showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by
available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/
reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves
 open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where
they usually differ .
tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2.49 and at angles
of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnation
point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at
creased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreased
about 20 percent at 15degree angle of attack .
preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibility
that this type of design may be developed to give heating rates
significantly lower than even the flat-faced cylinder rates . the test results
 have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenon
which can increase the heating rates to extremely high values .

ratios of the separation were
smaller in magnitude than flat plate

  it was found that the shape of
the shock wave indicated the existence
of an outward deflection of the flow
over the plate .  the flow deflection
caused an outward deflection of the
shock-wave asymptote of approximately
the shock-wave angle calculated
including boundary-layer growth .  the
mach number distributions in the

predictions based on shock-wave shape .

heat-transfer coefficients for the blunted
flat plates agreed with the
measured heat-transfer coefficients .  a
comparison between the measured
heat-transfer coefficients for the blunted
flat plates and the calculated

.W
a study of second-order supersonic flow theory .
  an attempt is made to develop a second approximation to the
solution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved by
existing first-order theory .  the method of attack adopted is an
iteration process using the linearized solution as the first step .
  for plane flow it is found that a particular integral of the
iteration equation can be written down at once in terms of the
first-order solution .  the second-order problem is thereby
reduced to an equivalent first-order problem and can be readily
solved .  at the surface of an isolated body, the solution reduces
to the well-known result of busemann .  the plane case is
considered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the
nature of the iteration process .
  again, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced to a
first-order problem by the discovery of a particular integral .
for smooth bodies, the second-order solution can then be
calculated by the method of von karman and moore .  bodies
with corners are also treated by a slight modification of the
method .  the second-order solution for cones represents a
considerable improvement over the linearized result .
second-order theory also agrees well with several solutions for other
bodies of revolution calculated by the numerical method of
characteristics .
  for full three-dimensional flow, only a partial particular
integral has been found .  as an example of a more general
problem, the solution is derived for an inclined cone .  the
possibility of treating other inclined bodies of revolution and
three-dimensional wings is discussed briefly .

on supersonic flow past a slightly yawing cone .
  this paper is concerned
with the motion of a circular cone, of
not too blunt an angle, through air at high
speed .  if the direction of motion of
the cone coincides with its axis of symmetry,
the resulting air flow is well known .
here we consider the perturbation produced
by a small /yaw/--i.e., the case in
which the cone is moving not quite in the
direction of its axis .  the results are
confirmed experimentally, and have applications
to ballistics, though we are not
concerned with the latter here,. they may
also be useful as providing a check on
various approximate methods of wider
applicability .  the square of the yaw is
neglected--an approximation of which the
validity is discussed .  (similar
methods can be applied to the second-order effects
of the yaw, which are also of ballistic
significance,. but the computations have not
yet been completed .)  it should be
observed that, because of the lack of symmetry,
the flow will be neither
irrotational nor isentropic .

  linearized slender-body theory
is applied to the computation of
aerodynamic forces on an oscillating,

flow .  the undeformed body is a body
of revolution and the deformed body
is represented by movement of a line
through the centers of the cross
sections which are assumed to remain
circular .  the time dependence is
based on sinusoidal motion .
  for a body of vanishing thickness
the slender-body theory yields
the apparent mass approximation as it
is obtained for incompressible
crossflow around a cylinder .
  both linearized slender-body theory
and the apparent mass
approximation are used to calculate the
pitching-moment coefficients on a rigid
slender body with a parabolic arc nose

an electronic apparatus for automatic recording of
the logarithmic decrement and frequency for oscillations
in the audio and subaudio frequency range .
  an electronic apparatus for automatic
evaluation of the damping of a harmonic
oscillation has been designed and constructed .
the apparatus is based on the idea
of representing the harmonic damped
oscillation by a rotating vector on the screen
of a cathode-ray tube in such a way, that
the rate of decrease of the length of the
vector is a measure of the damping .  the
results are obtained simultaneously with
the oscillation test as two numbers in
decimal digits, which are inversely
proportional to the logarithmic decrement and
the frequency, respectively .  the
apparatus, which is named the /dampometer/,
has been used for some time for free
oscillation measurements of the dynamic
stability derivatives of aeroplane models
in windtunnels, and has proved to be very
satisfactory .  it gives results of usually
higher accuracy than evaluation methods in
common use, and permits a most considerable
saving of time .

steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speeds
on two space-vehicle payload shapes .
  steady and fluctuating pressures
have been measured at mach numbers
which were varied from 0.6 to 1.2 on
two bodies of revolution typical of
two space-vehicle payload shapes, the
centaur and the able v .
  the results of the investigation
showed that significant fluctuations
of pressure occurred on both bodies
between mach numbers of 0.75 and 1.00 .
the maximum fluctuations measured at
any mach number and angle of attack
occurred in the region of the normal
shock wave as a result of
shock-wave motion .  large regions of unsteady
pressure also occurred as a result
of separation on the converging afterbody
of the able-v model .  the maximum
pressure fluctuations occurring on the
bodies increased with increasing
angle of attack .  for angles other than
are indicated since pressure fluctuations
were larger on the upper half
of the bodies than on the lower half .
  no definite conclusions could be
drawn regarding the form of the
spectral densities of pressure
fluctuations in the region of the shock
wave .  the spectral densities in regions
of separation following the
shock wave appeared flat except for some
increase in energy level below
due to slight model motions .

measurements of aerodynamic forces for various mean

with emphasis on damping in the stall .
  the oscillating air forces on a two-dimensional wing
oscillating in pitch about the midchord have been measured at various
mean angles of attack and at mach numbers of 0.35 and 0.7 .
the magnitudes of normal-force and pitching-moment coefficients
were much higher at high angles of attack than at low angles of
attack for some conditions .  large regions of negative damping
in pitch were found, and it was shown that the effect of increasing
the mach number from 0.35 to 0.7 was to decrease the initial
angle of attack at which negative damping occurred .
  measurements of the aerodynamic damping of a 10-
percent-thick and of a 3-percent-thick finite-span wing oscillating in
the first bending mode indicate no regions of negative damping
for this type of motion over the range of variables covered .  the
damping measured at high angles of attack was generally larger
than that at low angles of attack .

  the increasing use of fiber and whisker

methods of analyzing cylinders and cones
composed of an orthotropic material .  this paper treats
the buckling of such shells under a combination
of axial compression and uniform external pressure .
the differential equation approach of flugge is
used, and the resulting buckling equation is
presented in terms of axial and circumferential
bending rigidities, shear rigidity, poisson's ratio,
geometry parameters and mode shapes .  design
curves are presented which allow quick
determination of critical loads on cylinders, and, by using
the equivalent cylinder concept, on conical shells
of small included angle .  the curves also lend
themselves to /tailoring/ of materials to fit the load

.W
plastic stability theory of thin shells .
  considerable interest is currently centered on the
role of deformation and flow types of plasticity
theories in the solution of stability problems .  for
thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with
classical stability theory appears to yield results which
are in substantially good agreement with test data .
on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear
to require the introduction of initial imperfections in
order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with
tests .
  thus, in view of the current state of development of
plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit
the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation
theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of
thin shells .  although there may be theoretical
objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on
flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results
obtained from this theory .
  in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential
equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant
unequal radii is derived .  this set of three equations
applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any
loading system leading to buckling .  for particular
problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial
compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres
under external pressure, the set of equations can be
reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential
equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial
displacement only .  these donnell-type equations are
used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres
under external pressure and long and moderate length
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  the
limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under
compression or shear, represent the solutions for short
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .

on the role of initial imperfections in plastic buckling
of cylinders under axial compression .
in a recent paper lee treated the complex problem of the
plastic buckling and postbuckling behavior of an axially
compressed cylindrical shell containing initial imperfections,
representing an important step forward in our understanding of this
common, yet perplexing, structural element .  lee drew two
major conclusions ..  (a) even with initial imperfections the
incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the
buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory,
which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and
strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are
significant .
  it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion
in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other
experimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6
aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic
buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential
modes .  in particular, this writer does not believe that lee has
proved that initial imperfections are important for the group
of cylinders that he has tested .  on the contrary, it is believed
that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this
group of cylinders although of probable significance in other
cases .

the buckling of sandwich type panels .
  fifty-one flat rectangular sandwich-type panels were tested
in edgewise compression with the unloaded edges of the panels
restrained by v-grooves .  the sandwich consisted of papreg
faces and a cellular cellulose acetate core .  the thickness of the
faces varied from 0.00675 to 0.02025 in.,. the core, from 0.066
to 0.741 in.,. the width of the panel, from 4 to 11 in .  the length
of the panel was always 10.5 in .  the buckled shape consisted of
a ripple of short wave length across the panel .  it was either
symmetric, the two faces bulging out symmetrically according
to sine curves, or skew, the two faces deflecting in the same sense
according to sine curves having a phase angle of 90 .
  a strain energy theory of buckling is presented for both the
symmetric and the skew cases, and the buckling load in the
symmetric case is also calculated by integration of the differential
equation .  the agreement between the theoretic and the
experimental buckling stress is reasonable, that between the predicted
and actual buckled shape good .  a simple formula is developed
which permits a choice of the most suitable core material when the
mechanical properties of the face material are given .

torispherical shells - a caution to designers .
  it has recently become apparent, through
a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case
that designing torispherical shells by the
current edition of the asme code on unfired
pressure vessels can lead to failure during
proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose
of the present paper is to show in what
respects the code fails to give accurate results .
as an illustrative example, a hypothetical
pressure vessel with a torispherical head
having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was
selected .  the supports of the vessel were
considered to be either on the main cylinder
or around the torus .  the vessel was
subjected to internal pressure and the elastic
stresses in it were determined rigorously and
by the code .  a comparison of the two
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the
head which were less than one half of those
actually occurring .  furthermore, the code
gave no indication of the presence of high
compressive circumferential direct stresses
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically
the entire torus .  if the head had been
fabricated using a steel with a yield point of
would have failed or undergone large
deformations, whereas the code would have
predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules
for torispherical heads are thus in need of
revision for certain geometries .  the
implications of the foregoing results are currently
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,
however, designers should exercise care in
applying the code to torispherical shells .
  it is also shown in the paper that the use
of the membrane state as a particular
solution of the differential equations is not a
good approximation for toroidal shells of the
type considered .

on the theory of thin elastic toroidal shells .
  the author obtains asymptotic solutions to the problem
of rotationally symmetric small deflection of thin toroidal
elastic shells .  he first reduces the problem to that of
integrating a single linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential
equation involving two parameters .  asymptotic formulae
for the complementary function are obtained by applying
the general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33,
advantage of yielding results valid near the points where
the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution,
where the methods of asymptotic integration customary in
shell theory fail (see the preceding review) .  for two
problems in which only the complementary function is required,
the author's results are compared with those obtained by
wissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) by a method of power
series expansion,. the agreement is within 4 or better .  the
author observes that the usual method of obtaining
asymptotic expressions for a particular integral, being based on
using as an approximation the complementary function
obtained from the membrane theory, will fail near points
where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of
revolution .  he therefore introduces a new method, which
he states was developed jointly with e. reissner .  he applies
his results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetrically
and parallel to its axis, a corrugated pipe subject to axial
load, and a corrugated cylinder subject to axial pressure .
many numerical calculations are involved and there are two
tables of functions occuring in the solutions .

  the incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillating
vehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, and
the assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetric .
time-wise drag variations are thus represented as changes in the
wake diameter and velocity defect .  it is shown that the

.W
slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft models
operating near the ground .
a collection of data from a number of brief investigations made with
three different models to determine the character of the slipstream flow
along the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtol
aircraft configurations operating near the ground .  in general, the tests
involved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for
several tilt-wing vtol models .  a more extensive series of tests,
including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream
and some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching
moments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering
condition near the ground .
the results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a stronger
and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to
some extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one
wing), than to the side of the aircraft .  this effect is caused by an
intensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes
of flow symmetry .  the intensified flow along the center line of the
aircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the
dynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be
expected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers .
in the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small,
was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be
thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on
the ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of the
gravel) .  results of the investigation of moment fluctuations
indicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing,
and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erratic
inflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source of
these moments .

heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper
atmosphere .
a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic
theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for
steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution
was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily
extended to bodies of arbitrary shape .
it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of
solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of
negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to
steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar
radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly
important as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150
miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that
determines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar
radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of
nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures .
in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the
angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should
be kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice
by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at
small angles of attack .
it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring
thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive
and negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface
as possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically,
this may be accomplished by boattailing the body .
in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is
shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of
magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally
by emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural
radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures .
it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide
range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity
of the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is
based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent
of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy .
a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by
the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in
thermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be
used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation
coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .

conditions for the existence of similar solutions are known for (a)
two-dimensional, incompressible, steady and nonsteady laminar boundary
layers and (b) three-dimensional, incompressible, steady, laminar
boundary layers for a body of revolution rotating in a fluid at rest or
a body of revolution in a rotating fluid flow .  corresponding
conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers in
both cases are given for constant and variable wall temperatures .  the
general conclusion is that, in all these cases, with or without viscous
heating, and with constant wall temperature, conditions for the
existence of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the
conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers .
if the wall temperature is variable, the conditions for the existence
of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the
conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers if the
wall temperature varies as a power of the local free-stream velocity
or surface velocity .  numberical solutions are given for the
nondimensional temprature distributions function and the nondimensional
temperature gradient at the wall for several prandtl numbers in the case
of a rotating flow over an infinite plate at rest .

the inviscid flow between the detached shock wave and the surface of
a blunt body travelling at supersonic speed .  detailed experimental
data are needed for comparison .  experiments have been made in the
supersonic wind tunnels of the jet propulsion laboratory on spheres,
disks, and blunted cones over the mach number range 1.8 to 5.0 in air .
surface pressures, shock wave shape and detachment distance, certain
velocity gradients, the sonic line location, and some streamline paths
were determined .  the sonic line is found as the trace of the
termination point of a weak shock generated by a probe ahead of the model .
for a sphere, good agreement between theory (of van dyke) and experiment

a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a
choked wind tunnel .
the degree to which experimental results obtained under choking
conditions in a wind tunnel with solid walls simulate those associated with
an unbounded flow with free-stream mach number 1 is investigated for the
 cases of two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows . it is found that a
close resemblance does indeed exist in the vicinity of the body, and
that the results obtained in this way are generally at least as accurate
 as those obtained in a transonic wind tunnel with partly open test
section . some of the results indicate, however, that substantial
interference effects, particularly those of the wave reflection type, may
be encountered under certain conditions, both in choked wind tunnels and
 in transonic wind tunnels, and that the reduction of these interference
 effects to acceptable limits may require the use of models of unusually
 small size .

.W
on the influence of wall boundary layers in closed transonic test
sections .
the boundary layers at the test section walls of a transonic wind tunnel
 are known to reduce the wall interference . in the present paper this
effect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assuming
viscosity to be negligible when perturbing a turbulent boundary layer . an
approximation for thin boundary layers leads to a modified boundary
condition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normal
streamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflow
within the boundary layer . this boundary condition is applied to the
linearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonic
equations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only
 being treated in detail .
the results of linear theory show that all corrections except the
three-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by
 the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9,
the essential part of their influence being due to the change of mass
flow density with pressure . in the case of choking the analysis
indicates that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximum
model size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding to
mach number one in free flight . finally, the technique of using
artificial thickening of the wall boundary layers for a reduction of wall
interference is considered, though without reaching a definite
conclusion as to its value as compared to other techniques .

pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means of
balance measurements have been carried out for a number of models at
high subsonic velocity in wind tunnels, where the boundary layer of the
walls has been varied . within the investigated range it appeared that a
 thickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence of
the walls, which also caused an increase of the choking mach number .
the phenomenon described should be of a certain importance from the
point of view of wind tunnel technique, since it is possible to increase
 the choking velocity for a given model by means of thickening the
boundary layer .

millimeters of mercury .  hydrogen and helium
were used as driver gases .
  a helium-driven shock wave was found
to decay only about one-half
as rapidly as a hydrogen-driven shock wave .
the pressure level had
little effect on the attenuation rate of
a shock wave of given strength

static-pressure measurements
indicated that a severe pressure gradient

effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics

  an investigation has been made
to study the effect of ground
proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics
of a four-engine vertical-
take-off-and-landing transport-airplane
model with tilting wing and
propellers .  tests were made with the wing
at an angle of incidence of 90,
the position used for vertical take-off
or landing .  with the model at
various heights above the ground, the
lift, drag, and pitching moment
were measured and tuft studies were
made to determine the flow field
caused by the propeller slipstream .
data were obtained for the complete
model, for the model with horizontal
tail removed, and for the
wing-propeller combination alone .
  the results of the investigation
showed that, when the model was
hovering near the ground, there was a
strong upwash in the plane of
symmetry and also an increase in lift
of about 10 percent of the
propeller thrust .  about one-half of this
lift resulted from an increase
in propeller thrust and one-half resulted
from an up load on the
fuselage induced by the upwash .  as the model
approached the ground, it also
experienced an increasing nose-down
pitching moment that evidently
resulted from the up load on the fuselage,
the rear part of which was
longer than the front part .  the addition
of the horizontal tail which
was located about halfway up the vertical
tail did not increase the
nose-down pitching moment because the
fuselage decreased the energy of
the upwash before it reached the tail .

an investigation of the effect of downwash from a vtol
aircraft and a helicopter in the ground environment .
  dynamic-pressure measurement,
in ground effect, have been obtained
about a single-rotor helicopter and
a dual-propeller vtol aircraft .  the
results indicate that the slipstream
dynamic pressure along the ground,
some distance from the center of
rotation, is not a function of disk
loading but merely a function of
the gross weight or thrust of the
aircraft .  furthermore, for a given
gross weight the thickness of this
outward flowing sheet of air is less
for a small-diameter propeller (higher
disk loading propeller) .
  the variation of the dynamic-pressure
flow field for single and
dual propellers or rotors is significantly
different in the plane of
symmetry between the two rotors than
in a direction normal to this
plane .  the interaction of the two
flows produces a region of upflow
in this plane where the fuselage is
located, and the decay of the
maximum dynamic pressure with distance
ahead of the fuselage is slower .

an experimental study of the effect of downwash from

ground surfaces .
  a full-scale, twin-propeller
vtol aircraft with a maximum gross
weight of 3,400 pounds has been
operated on the ground to study the
effect of downwash on several types
of ground surfaces .
  static operation over loose snow
indicated a zone of obliterated
vision ahead of the pilot in an arc of
approximately 10 on each side
of the plane of symmetry .  an arc 10
to 45 each side of the center
line was found to be an area of fair
visibility while the arc from 45
to 90 was an area of poor visibility .
  static operation in the presence
of loose surface material
indicated that the downwash cleared the
area near the aircraft of these
particles without recirculation or
damage to any components .
  short-time operation at moderate
forward speed over loose gravel,
with the thrust axis at an angle of
in propeller-blade erosion and numerous
small dents and fabric
punctures in the sides of the fuselage .
the propeller-blade erosion was
superficial except for the leading
edges where several layers of glass
fiber were eroded .

vtol stol aircraft as a result of
operating from a level surface covered
with loose gravel .  the damage was
inadvertently incurred as the aircraft
was performing a taxiing-turn maneuver
over an area of level macadam
surface containing loose and embedded
crushed stone .  observers from a chase
aircraft commented that the wing was
tilted at approximately 76 with
respect to the ground when the damage
occurred .  deposits of stone in the
open fuselage, punctures in the rotor
blade skin, and damage to the
compressor blades of the engine occurred
due to the circulation of the

hangling qualities experience with several vtol research
aircraft .
  all of the vtol research aircraft
discussed in this paper have
successfully demonstrated conversion from
hovering to airplane flight and
vice versa .  however, control about one
or more axes of these aircraft
has been inadequate in hovering flight .
furthermore, ground interference
effects have been severe in some cases
and have accentuated the inadequacy
of control in hovering and very low
speed flight .
  stalling of wing surfaces has resulted
in limitations in level-flight
deceleration and in descent, particularly
for the tilt-wing aircraft, which
in this case is a very rudimentary type .
minor modifications to the wing
leading edge have, however, produced
surprisingly large and encouraging
reductions in adverse stall effects .
  height control in hovering and in
low-speed flight has proved to
be a problem for the aircraft not having
direct control of the pitch of
the rotors .  the other systems have shown
undesirable time lags in
development of a thrust change .

elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilized
by a soft elastic core .
  the effect of a soft elastic core upon the
buckling strength of a thin, circular, cylindrical shell is
investigated experimentally .  two types of loading are
considered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform
radial-band loading, where the width of the band is small
compared to the length of the shell .
  for each type of loading it is shown that the
strengthening effect of the elastic core becomes more significant
with the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio .
for example, it is shown that for the geometric and
elastic constants considered it is possible, with the presence
of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as
much as 65 percent over the values found for those
without an elastic core .  the elastic core is even more
effective in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to band
loading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filled
specimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle the
unfilled shell .

the buckling of cylindrical shells under longitudinally varying loads .
two problems illustrating the effect of nonuniformity of loading
on the buckling characteristics of circular cylinders are
investigated .  the first problem deals with the effect of
linearly varying axial compressive stress, such as would be
produced by the weight of the propellant in a solid-propellant
engine case .  the results indicate that the ratio of the maximum
critical compressive stress induced by the shear load to the
critical uniform compressive stress varies from 1.9 for
the curvature parameter z equal to 1.6 as z
becomes infinite .  in particular, the increase in stress is
less than 20 per sq. ft. for z greater than 100 .
the stability of thin cylinders loaded by lateral external
pressure varying linearly in the longitudinal direction is also
investigated .  the results indicate that for z greater than 100,
the buckling coefficients are proportional to square
root z .

.W
stresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressure
vessels .
  a short discussion is given of the possible methods for
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local
loadings .  it is concluded that the method of developing
the loads and displacements into double fourier series
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical
evaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressions
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by
reducing the three partial differential equations of the
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical
with, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of the
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external
loading in this equation leads directly to a double series
expression of the radial displacement w in terms of the load
factors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent
expressions for the other displacements and for the
bending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to
it are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,
tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the
circumferential direction, (d) a moment in the
circumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short
distance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these
loadings the load factors, which have to be used in the
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending
moments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential
equation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the
tangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the
displacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for
tangential loading within a rectangle are found .

  thirteen stainless-steel ring-stiffened
cylinders were subjected to a pure
bending load and heated rapidly until
buckling occurred .  for most of the
cylinders the heating was not uniform around
the circumference so that appreciable
axial thermal stresses were present .
elementary thermal stress theory was found
to be inadequate for the prediction of
these thermal stresses, but a method was
developed that would give satisfactory
thermal stress results .  by properly
accounting for the thermal stress, the
buckling load could be correlated with a
theory for the buckling of an axially

a theory of asymmetric hypersonic blunt-body flows .
two-dimensional asymmetric and three-dimensional
inviscid blunt-body flows are analyzed
using a new method .  the method is inverse, that
is, the shock-wave shape and freestream
conditions are taken as known, and the body shape
and flow field are to be determined .
results at zero angle of attack are obtained as a special
case of the general problem .  solutions at
zero angle are calculated for a variety of body shapes
at freestream mach numbers ranging from
infinity to 1.85 .  the ratio of specific heats, is taken
as 1.4 .  comparison with results obtained
using van dyke's and garabedian's numerical
solutions indicates that the method under
consideration is more accurate than the van dyke
method for determining stand-off distance .
solutions are obtained for parabolic and paraboloidal
shock waves at small angle of attack and
infinite freestream mach number,. assumes the
values 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.05 .  for all cases,
the streamline that wets the body passes through
the shock wave slightly above the point
where the shock is normal and thus does not possess
maximum entropy .  these results
provide counter examples to the conjecture that any
isolated convex body in a supersonic stream
is wetted by the streamline of maximum entropy .

  this paper presents a study of the steady
two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow of an
infinitely conducting fluid past a nonconducting
wedge with nonaligned flow and magnetic
field .  the flows considered are in the /superfast/
or fully hyperbolic regime .  the flows consist
of several regions of uniformity connected by
shocks and expansion waves .  because of the
boundary condition on the magnetic field, the
magnetic field must be the same in the regions
above and below the wedge,. thus the flows in these
regions are coupled, unlike in the case of
ordinary supersonic gasdynamics .  only small wedge
angles and weak waves (characteristics) are
considered .  the problem thus is linearized, and
explicit solutions are obtained which are
qualitatively similar to the nonlinear solutions .
some interesting and unexpected features
arise, and they are discussed in detail .

an approximate solution for laminar boundary layer flow .
this paper presents an approximate solution for two-dimensional,
incompressible, laminar boundary layer flow with arbitrary pressure
gradient . von mises' form of the boundary layer equation is linearized
by making a change in the coefficient of one of the terms .  the
linearized equation yields a solution that is accurate for the outer portion
of the flow but inaccurate near the surface .  a separate inner solution
then is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins with
the outer solution at some point within the boundary layer .  the
method may be considered a major modification of one developed earlier
by von karman and millikan, with changes in both outer and inner
solutions, and the point at which the two solutions are joined .  the changes
improve the accuracy of the method and in some respects simplify the
calculations .  as examples, results are presented for flow with a
linear variation of velocity (including flat plate and stagnation
point flow as special cases), flow with sinusoidal variation of
velocity, flow past a circular cylinder (heimenz' velocity
distribution), and flow past an ellipse (schubauer's data) . agreement
with theoretically exact solutions is good, and better than
results obtained using the pohlhausen method .

laminar hypersonic trail in the expansion-conduction

  the usual procedure in calculating the cooling
process in a wake behind a blunt object is to
assume a region of pure expansion up to a distance
where the pressure has reached its ambient
value, followed by a region where the mechanism
of pure heat conduction is operative .  in
the present paper both mechanisms are assumed
to be valid simultaneously, and the result is
compared with previous calculations .  the
following criterion is established ..  the minimum
radius of a hemisphere-cylinder configuration,
above which a simultaneous
conduction-expansion calculation is not needed, is given by

three dimensional effects in viscous wakes .
  three-dimensionality in wakelike or jetlike
free mixing may stem from initial geometric
configurations, nonuniformities in flow variables
over a cross section, or boundary conditions
along the flow .  these may be generated by
bodies at angle of attack, nonaxisymmetric
bodies, mixing of nonaxisymmetric jets with
an outer flow, finite wings, or more artificial
means .  this paper is devoted to studies bearing
on such configurations .  the first section
deals with the general mathematical model, in
which the boundary layer approximations
are used, and with methods of solution .
laminar and turbulent flow, compressibility,
unsteadiness, and streamwise pressure gradients
are admitted initially .  the flux forms of the
equations are given .  algebraic integrals of the
energy equations and the diffusion (
frozen-flow) equations are obtained .  a simplification
of the convective terms, roughly
corresponding to the oseen approximation, is used
in the asymptotic downstream region .
the second section contains explicit solutions
for specific configurations, in particular
for flows whose initial isovels are of elliptic shape .
these flows may be wakelike or jetlike .
compressibility is admitted,. however, the flows
must have uniform pressure and must be
steady .  the final section deals with interpretation

some exact solutions for cavitating curvilinear bodies .
  a special case of cavitating flow solutions is
postulated and transformed to a semi-infinite
plane .  the complete, exact solution then is
synthesized by superposition of singularities .
the solution is relevant to a general, two-parameter
family of curvilinear bodies .  the
parameters are the flow angles at the two points of flow
separation .  the body reduces, in the special
case, to the rayleigh solution for a flat plate .
the equations of the cavity boundaries are
given in explicit form .  the body form and the
stagnation streamline are given as the locus of
the roots of a cubic equation .  local static
pressures and, hence, lift and drag, also may be
calculated .  the generated solutions constitute
a technique involving simple computation
for exact solutions of a special family of cavitating
curvilinear bodies at finite angles of attack .

experiments with two-dimensional, transversely impinging jets .
  experiments on the interaction of transversely
impinging two-dimensional jet flows were
performed in which a low pressure control jet
flow interacted with a relatively high pressure
power jet flow .  the ratio of the control jet to
the power jet supply chamber gauge stagnation
pressure was adjusted at 0, 10, and 15 .
shadowgraphs of the power jet alone, as well as the
corresponding interacting jet flows, were
recorded to establish the nature of and changes in
the shock structure .  the jet flows were
traversed by a pitot tube to record the pitot pressure
distributions at various locations downstream
of the power jet exit .  it was discovered that
with the addition of only a small percent
control jet flow, the normal shock front of the highly
underexpanded power jet flow changed to
an oblique shock structure and, downstream of the
previous location of the normal shock which
appeared in the power jet flow alone, the
maximum recovery stagnation pressures were
proportionally much higher .  the mechanism for
this behavior of the normal shock is proposed .
possible practical importance of this behavior
of interacting jet flows with reference to aerodynamic
noise, supersonic diffuser losses, etc., is
also pointed out .  for the power jet flow alone it
was found that by considering the actual jet
boundaries as simply an extension of the actual
nozzle, the average axial flow quantities,
computed from the area-mach number relation using
the observed cross-sectional area of the jet
flow, agreed quite favorably with the experimental results .

unsteady aerodynamic forces on slender supersonic aircraft

  the present paper derives generalized aerodynamic
forces for slender supersonic aircraft on
the basis of slender-body theory .  particular
consideration is given to configurations which
are spanwise flexible .  to treat configurations
with flexible wings and bodies, the slender
wing-body problem is first reduced to a simple body
problem whose solution is well known, and a
solution of the latter is obtained, utilizing the
circle theorem or method of images and a known
solution of the airfoil equation for a double
interval .  with this approach, it is not necessary
to apply conformal mapping techniques,
and the solution so obtained is valid for arbitrary
spanwise downwash distributions .  on the
basis of slender-body theory, the velocity potential
and, subsequently, the generalized
aerodynamic forces are derived for a general class of
spanwise flexible wing-body configurations .

the blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flow .
  the present paper is mainly concerned with
the hypersonic flow over a flat plate with a
blunt nose .  the analysis is based on the flow
model in which the flow field behind the shock
wave may be divided into two regions ..  the
inviscid-hypersonic-flow region and the entropy
layer, across which the pressure has no appreciable
change .  the equations for the entropy
layer can be reduced to those of the usual
boundary-layer problem with the exception that
the outer edge of the entropy layer, as well
as the pressure remain unknown .  these
unknowns are determined so as to approximately
match the entropy-layer solution with the
inviscid hypersonic solution in which the shock
wave has the shape of the power law of the
distance from the leading edge .  the assumed
flow model is shown to be valid over a restricted
range depending on the wall-to-stagnation
temperature ratio and (where is
the reynolds number based on half the thickness
of nose t, m the freestream mach number,
and c the chapman-rubesin constant .
actual calculations have been carried out for the
case with typical values of and
the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio .
the calculated values for both the surface
pressure and heat-transfer rate are compared
with the experimental data .  as regards surface
pressure in particular, a satisfactory
agreement with the data is obtained .  the validity
of the assumptions upon which the present
analysis is based has been examined from the
numerical results, and the region of the validity
has been found to extend over a certain large range
of the nondimensional distance from the

theoretical investigations of a supersonic laminar
boundary layer with foreign-gas injection .
  the phenomena arising from the uniform injection of helium,
air, argon, and iodine into the laminar boundary layer of a
supersonic stream of air in a tube were investigated theoretically .
the partial differential equations describing the energy, mass,
and momentum transfers through the boundary layer were
obtained, and a series solution was found for the case of uniform
injection through the tube wall .  the results of the analysis are
in the form of axial distributions of wall temperature and
recovery factor and of radial distribution of concentration,
velocity, static, and stagnation temperatures .  the gas mixture
was assumed to be a perfect gas .  properties of the mixture were
calculated in accordance with the gibbs-dalton rule and the
mixing rules based on the kinetic theory of dilute gases .
transport properties for pure air were taken from the n.b.s.
tabulations .  transport properties for the other gases were calculated
by kinetic-theory methods, employing a lennard-jones 6-12
model for the interaction potential .  the theoretical predictions
for the recovery factor along the tube with air or argon injection
agree with experimental data to within one percent .  the
theoretical predictions for helium injection indicate an 8-percent
rise in the recovery factor along the tube, while experiments
have shown only a 1-percent rise .  these differences between
theory and experiment are attributed to inaccuracies in the
approximations to the transport properties of the binary mixtures .

hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate .
  this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the hypersonic
viscous flow over a sweat-cooled flat plate .  the physical
system under consideration is the hypersonic laminar boundary
layer over a porous flat plate with homogeneous, normal
injection of a coolant into the external stream .  a heat balance at
the porous surface is made between the heat transferred to the
surface and the heat absorbed by the coolant .  the existence
of similar solutions requires a nonuniform distribution of coolant
injection .  the method of solution consists of the integration of
three simultaneous first-order equations, the momentum and the
energy integral equations in the boundary layer, and the
tangent-wedge approximation in the inviscid layer .  first-order
asymptotic formulas are given in both the strong and the weak pressure
interaction regions for the induced surface pressure, the
skin-friction coefficient, and the nusselt number .  numerical
results for three specific cases are presented and discussed .

.W
a study of slender shapes of minimum drag using the
newton-busemann pressure coefficient law .
  the problem of minimizing the drag of a slender, two-
dimensional or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angle of
attack is considered under the assumption that the pressure
coefficient law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in
order to include centripetal acceleration effects .  after the
condition that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted
for and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition
to the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment
of inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the
wetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the
minimal problem is formulated as a problem of the mayer type and
solved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations,
the transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner
condition, and the properties of the switching function .
  particular attention is devoted to the class of problems such
that, among the four quantities being considered, two are
prescribed while the remaining are free .  for these problems, the
extremal arc is composed of two subarcs ..  one is characterized by
a positive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the
other is characterized by a zero pressure coefficient and is called
the free layer .  in this connection, the analysis shows the
existence of two different types of solutions depending on whether the
thickness is given or free .
  if the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape is
a power law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free
layer occurs in the second half of the body .  in the two-
dimensional case, the exponent of the power law is 1 if the length is given
if the enclosed area is given, and 3 if the moment of inertia
of the contour is given,. the transition point from the power
body to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the
length is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at
the axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if
the length is given, 1 if the wetted area is given, and if the
volume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the
free layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is
given, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent
if the volume is given .
  on the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free,
the equation governing the regular shape is not that of a power
body, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the
first half of the body .  in the two-dimensional case, the
transition point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the
enclosed area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment
of inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the
enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given .
in the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35
percent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given,
at 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46
percent if the wetted area and the volume are given .
  for all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are
obtained for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag
coefficients .

uniformly valid second-order solution for supersonic
flow over cruciform surfaces .
  considered is the second-order supersonic flow over a
cruciform configuration consisting of two intersecting rectangular
wings of high aspect ratio .  the practical interest is in
application to supersonic inlets, wing-body junctions and vehicle fins .
the fundamental interest centers about identification and
adjustment of the severe local failures of the ordinary second-order
theory .  for wings with discontinuous slopes, discontinuous
potentials occur across the planar shock and square-root
singularities in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks
with the cruciform surfaces .  the problem is simple enough so
that these interesting features stand out clearly .
  a second-order solution uniformly valid to first order is
constructed by adjustment of the ordinary second-order solution
obtained first .  the uniformly valid solution has two different
series representations in the thickness parameter .  one is the
ordinary second-order series in ascending integral powers of the
thickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the
vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone, and the other is a series
containing fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream
of this mach cone .  the uniformly valid solution gives the
detailed wave structure and shows a flow regime upstream of the
vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the
ordinary theory .  the two solutions are otherwise identical .
the wave structure consists of a pyramidal arrangement of planar
shocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by
weaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely
weak shocks coincident with the vertex-centered undisturbed
mach cone .  as an example of the above, detailed results are
presented for the case of two intersecting wedges .  application
of the techniques to other quasi-cylindrical problems is discussed .

the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic
shock wave into a moving monatomic fluid .
  an initially uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave of
arbitrary strength propagates through a channel which consists of
two portions of which one has uniform cross-sectional area while
the other is of varying cross-sectional area .  it is assumed that
the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initially
a uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations)
of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered .
when the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed,
the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is
nonisentropic .  in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the
area variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are
two further contributions--viz., a permanent perturbation
caused directly by the area changes and a transient
disturbance--which propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow
behind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent
perturbation at the shock .  expressions for these various contributions are
obtained .  the results presented include as special cases
propagation of a nonuniform conventional gas dynamic shock into a
moving nonconduction fluid and propagation of a nonuniform
hydromagnetic shock wave into a stationary fluid .

  inverted hemispheres, circular discs (normal to stream),

total-angle sharp cones, and other axisymmetric shapes were run in a
hypervelocity wind tunnel .  hypersonic drag coefficients at zero

efficient is defined as drag force .  knudsen number is
defined as mean free path behind shock sphere shock
detachment distance .  in the case of nonsphere shapes, the knudsen
number is defined as the knudsen number of a sphere with the
same base diameter .
  these drag coefficients cover the range of gasdynamics to free
molecule flow and are given in graphical form .  the drag
coefficients were measured by means of a ballistic balance in
millisecond intervals, and referenced to the drag coefficient of a
sphere in the gasdynamics region, for a gamma of 1.4, of 0.92 .
  tunnel stagnation conditions of pressure, temperature, density,
and pressure drop with time were measured directly .  in the
tunnel test section, velocity, q density, total pressure, and static
pressure were measured directly .
  these experimental curves have been found useful in the
analysis of complex shapes if the complex shapes can be easily broken
down into simple components with small interactions between
components .
  heat-transfer distributions have also been obtained on these
and other complex shapes in the hypervelocity wind tunnel, by
means of a special paint which changes through several visible
spectral orders within a heat transfer range of x10 for a single
application .  heat transfer rates, so obtained, have been
performed in the hypersonic gasdynamic and slip flow regions and
are presented for spheres .  these data, in the vorticity interaction
region, agree with the data of ferri and zakkay .

attained .
  transition was observed in the subsonic and near-sonic flow
region at and upstream of n = 45 .  in this region the stagnation
reynolds number at which transition occurred when the surface
was highly polished was only slightly affected by cooling within
the temperature range .  thus, transition
reversal does not occur on a polished spherical surface within the
range of these tests, and we therefore conclude that the cooling
did not cause the linear stability of boundary layer to decrease
significantly .
  an essential feature of transition studies with boundary-layer
cooling is the close control of surface roughness .  in the present
experiments this control required, in addition to a highly polished
surface, the necessity for low water vapor dewpoint, the
avoidance of carbon dioxide condensation and the utilzation of every
available means for removing the dust from the airstream .

supersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition .
  an analytical method is presented which permits a very rapid
evaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the addition
of small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensional
airfoils .  this method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heat
conduction .  also, the mechanism by which the sesired heat
addition is achieved is not considered .
  it is shown that even small amounts of heat generate a
substantial pressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in the
acrodynamic coefficients .  the results of this analysis compare
favorably with those obtained by a more accurate, but also more
tedious, graphical method of characteristics .
  two possible modes of application to an airplane design are
considered from the energy requirements standpoint .  in this
connection, it is shown that the decrease of the required wing
area resulting from heat addition may, in some cases, lead to
savings in the rate of the fuel consumption .  in general, however,
one should not expect any substantial reduction in energy
requirements resulting from the application of the wing heat
addition .

aerodynamic processes in the downwash-impingement problem .
  theoretical and experimental data relating to the downwash
impingement problem are examined in order to arrive at a
coherent understanding of the process of entrainment of ground
particles in the flow .  it is demonstrated that a key mechanism
in the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground
boundary layer with bluff ground particles .  this interaction
produces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals or
exceeds the particle weight .
  in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions
necessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas
in the impinging jet are examined .  these are the viscous decay,
the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces
on a bluff body in nonuniform flow .  applicable theories are
used in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy
and range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream
conditions which will cause particle entrainment .
  available data are applied to the establishment of criteria for
particle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet
stagnation point .  these criteria show that entrainment occurs in a
finite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles
most readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to about
two-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer .  the
configuration size is shown to influence the process in that the
onset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity,
and the size of the ground particles .  the criteria established
provide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causing
entrainment and provide a basis for scaling experimental results to
a variety of full-scale situations .

effect of uniformly distributed roughness on turbulent

  an experimental program was carried out in the 18-in. by

determine the effect of uniformly distributed sand-grain
roughness on the skin-friction drag of a body of revolution for the case
of a turbulent boundary layer .  the mach number range
covered was 1.98 to 4.54, and the reynolds number varied from
about 3 x 10 to 8 x 10 .  some data were also obtained at a
mach number of 0.70 .
  at speeds up to a mach number of 5 and for roughness sizes
such that the quadratic resistance law holds, the compressibility
effect is indirect, and the skin-friction drag is a function of only
the roughness reynolds number, exactly as in the
incompressible case .  it is shown that the entire compressibility effect
is a reduction of the fluid density at the surface as the mach
number increases .  the critical roughness, below which the
surface is hydraulically smooth, is,. this is equal
to the thickness of the laminar sublayer for a smooth surface for
both compressible and incompressible flow .  over the range of
roughness sizes considered here, there appears to be no wave drag
associated with the drag due to roughness .  the shift in the
turbulent veocity profile for a rough surface at supersonic
speeds is a function of only the roughness reynolds number
and quantitatively follows exactly the same law as that
for the incompressible case .

heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow,
including effects of yaw and nose bluntness .
  as part of a general study of the aerothermodynamic
characteristics of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation of
laminar heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conducted .
experiments have been made in the cal 11- by 15-in. shock
tunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up to
were tested .
  the heat-transfer rates are compared with theoretical
predictions .  the effects on the local heat-transfer rates of the
boundary-layer displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw,
nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussed .  it is
shown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharp
cone are in good agreement with theory when boundary-layer
displacement and transverse-curvature effects are included .
for the yawed sharp cone, the heat-transfer rates along the
most windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko's
theory for yaw angles up to 3 .  at larger yaw angles, the
experimental heat transfer was found to be greater than that
predicted theoretically .  however, at these yaw angles the
heat-transfer distribution on the windward side was in good
agreement with laminar-boundary-layer calculations based on an
assumption of local similarity .  the zero-yaw tests of the blunted
cones showed qualitative agreement with cheng's shock-layer
theory for slender blunt-nose bodies .

the drag of elongated bodies over a wide reynolds number
range .
  the resistance of bodies in motion through an incompressible
viscous fluid is predictable from stokes- or oseen-type solutions
in the creeping-motion range, while some test information is
available in the boundary-layer range .  with the exception of
experimental results for spheres or circular cylinders and
analytical and experimental results for flat plates, almost no information
is available on other bodies, particularly in the intermediate
range of reynolds numbers extending from unity to a million .
  experimental results as obtained from hydroballistic studies
in water and glycerin-water solutions are presented for finned
ellipsoids of fineness-ratio .4 over a 20,000-fold range and are
correlated with available information on other bodies .  although
results do not extend down to the creeping-motion region where
analytical predictions are available, comparison with the drag
coefficient trends for spheres and flat plates indicates that an
appropriate curve for the ellipsoid could be extended so as to cover
the entire laminar-viscous range .  less extensive results are
presented on the drag of fineness-ratio 8 ellipsoids and on
laminar-turbulent transition occurrences .

the effect of slip particularly for highly cooled walls .
  it is found that for boundary conditions on the velocity slip
and on the temperature jump which are not oversimplified in an
unrealistic way, the effect of these phenomena on the heat transfer
and the shear at a stagnation point is of the order of the ratio of
the mean free path outside the boundary layer to the
boundary-layer thickness, even for highly cooled walls .  a simplified
theory of this effect is given, which puts the physical reasons for
the results in evidence and agrees closely with the more accurate
calculations .  it is concluded that the effects of slip and jump
are not negligible in comparison with other low-reynolds-number
corrections, even for very cold walls .

pressure distribution in regions of step-induced turbulent
separation .
  an analysis is made of the pressure distribution in the
separated-flow region ahead of a step, using the concept of the
turbulent mixing coefficient of crocco and lees and the /jet-flow/
model of chapman with some modification .  on the basis of
a variable mixing coefficient, a differential equation for the
pressure distribution is derived, which gives the pressure rise as a
function of the distance from the separation point .  this
equation contains the separation length as an unknown .  a second
equation is obtained by making a mass balance of the air entering
and, leaving the /dead-air/ region ahead of the step .  the
pressure rise and the separation distance for a given mach
number are determined by solving the two equations simultaneously .
  the analysis yields results which are in close agreement with
the experimental data on steps, obtained at princeton,
particularly for m = 3.85 .  for lower mach numbers, a maximum
variation of 5 percent is found between theory and experiment .
use of the velocity profiles of jets, as required by the jet-flow
model, necessarily restricts the applicability of the present study
to flows with thin boundary layers at the separation point .

application of inequality constraints to variational

  inequality constraints are introduced into the variational
formulation of the optimum re-entry problem for a lifting
vehicle to prevent human and or structural tolerances from being
exceeded .  these constraints consist of minimum and maximum
angle of attack, maximum load factor, and maximum convective
heat transfer (equilibrium temperature) .
  the equations have been programed for the ibm 704
computer, and sample trajectories are presented for which the total
heat transferred to certain critical areas on the windward
surface of the vehicle is minimized .  these trajectories indicate the
dominant effect of the constraints on the optimum flight path,

sphere cone drag is consistently less than, but generally parallel
these bodies is generally well predicted by the newtonian theory
except at small and moderate positive angles of attack where it is
generally less than newtonian .  this lift deficiency appears to
increase with cone half angle .  maximum lift-drag ratios fall
considerably short of the newtonian predictions .  several
exploratory tests at mach 11.7 and low reynolds number (

boundary layer transition in the presence of streamwise
vortices .
  results of an experimental investigation of instability leading
to transition in the subsonic boundary layer flow along a flat
plate are presented .  a series of wings was placed outside the
boundary layer to produce streamwise vortices, which in turn
made the boundary layer three-dimensional--i.e., periodic in
thickness in the spanwise direction .  hot-wire measurements
were made to trace the downstream development of the
disturbance or wave created by the vibrating ribbon .  as the wave
travels downstream, it is deformed into a three-dimensional
configuration by the three-dimensionality of the boundary-layer
flow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small in
intensity .  it is only after the wave intensity exceeds a certain
amount (which depends on the degree of boundary-layer
three-dimensionality) that the nonlinear effect manifests itself by the
rapid amplification of wave intensity, the rapid increase in wave
three-dimensionality, and the distortion in mean velocity profile .
the appearance of nonlinear development inevitably leads to the
breakdown of laminar flow, and hence the onset of turbulence .
there is present a mechanism by which the energy is transferred
from one spanwise position to another so that the breakdown of
laminar flow occurs as a consequence of three-dimensional
development of the wave as a whole .

terms ..  given reasonable estimates for shock shape and

problems for which closed form solutions are available .  the

the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of
turbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams .
tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determine
the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary
layers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface models
having adverse pressure gradients .  the magnitude of the gradients
relative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the
gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of
curvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at the
beginning of the gradient .  the overall pressure rise in most cases was
greater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layer
to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave .
an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of
the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of
cases outside the range of the experiments .
it is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predicted
from the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measured
values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with
values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional
methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow .  a new
procedure for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in this
paper, is shown to provide a good correlation between experimental
and calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adverse
pressure gradients created by curved surfaces .  this procedure is based
on the experimental observation that the station at which high-energy
free-stream flow actually mixes into a turbulent boundary layer in
an adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station at
which flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flat-plate profile .

heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablation
of vapor of arbitrary molecular weight .
  the reduction of heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer
under the condition of vaporizing ablation is analyzed for
arbitrary molecular weight of the vapor .  primary assumptions are
that the pressure gradient is zero, the individual components of
the binary system are perfect gases, the prandtl number is
constant, and the viscosity is proportional to temperature .
variations through the boundary layer of the schmidt number for
binary diffusion and the density-viscosity product, are
included in the analysis .  the wall temperature is held constant .
numerical results are obtained for prandtl numbers of 0.75 and
varying from 0.25 to 4.00, wall concentration of the foreign gas
as high as 0.9 (corresponding to the high heat rates encountered
during re-entry), and ratio of specific heats of foreign gas equal
to that of air .  kinetic theory is used to obtain schmidt number
as a function of molecular weight and concentration .
  the departure of schmidt number and prandtl number from
unity and the variation of reynolds analogy factor with prandtl
number, blowing parameter, wall concentration, and molecular
weight ratio are found to have relatively minor influence on the
heat block ratio at high rates of ablation .  the primary factor
governing the influence of molecular weight ratio on the heat
block ratio is the variation of across the boundary layer .
little loss of accuracy is incurred, in the range of molecular weight
ratios considered here, by assuming schmidt and prandtl
numbers of unity as long as the variation is properly taken into account .

helium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two-dimensional wings
at zero angle of attack with sweep angles up to 70 at mach
numbers from 7 to 15 .  the leading edge reynolds number varied
from 3,000 to 25,000 .  the measured pressure distributions were
compared with the simple summation of the theoretical inviscid
effect (based on blast wave theory using the normal mach
number) added to the viscous effect (calculated as if no sweep
were present) .  for the unswept wing, the slope of the pressure
decay was reasonably well predicted by the theoretical
calculations .  the viscous theory reasonably predicted the variation in
the pressure distribution due to changes in leading-edge
reynolds number .  by subtracting the theoretical viscous effects, an
inviscid mach number dependence of the 2.2 power was found
as compared to the value of 2.0 predicted by the inviscid theory .
the same approach for the swept wing did not give consistently
satisfactory results .  deviations avove and below the calculated
value by as much as 40-50 percent were measured and there
seemed to be no systematic variation with either mach number or
reynolds number .  at a constant high reynolds number, it was
found that the pressure distribution varied with the distance
along the wing with an exponent between about--0.53 and--0.58
except for a rather sharp decrease which occurred for the 70
sweep case .  the pressure at a given station for a fixed mach
number and given leading edge thickness varied as the cosine of
the sweep angle to the 1.1 power as compared to the 1.3 power
predicted from general geometrical considerations .

a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer
over a curved surface .
  the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for
surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer
flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .
  the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated
by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the
generalized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is
applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation
in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer
equations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the
boundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple
transformation, the governing differential equation can be
expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation
for zero surface curvature .
  numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a
flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient
have been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer
and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex
surfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall
is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on
the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop
below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to
reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase
again .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a
different method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results
with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic
differences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular,
murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex
surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall
it is higher .

foreign-gas injection into a compressible turbulent
boundary layer on a flat plate .
  the distributed injection of a foreign gas into a compressible,
turbulent boundary layer in the absence of a pressure gradient is
considered .  the analysis is performed within the framework of
the binary-mixture concept, that is, the primary fluid flowing
over the surface represents one component while the injected
species represents the second .
  calculations have been performed for the injection of helium
into undissociated air .  the results indicate an effect of mach
number on surface shear and energy transfer when distributed
light-gas injection normal to the surface exists .  a comparison
with experimental data indicates reasonable agreement over a
range of mach numbers .

the newtonian approximation in magnetic hypersonic
stagnation-point flow .
  the hypersonic flow of an electrically conducting fluid around
the stagnation region of a sphere carrying a radial magnetic field
is examined .
  by assuming a newtonian pressure distribution and constant
density, the differential equation of the inviscid flow is integrated
and a simple closed-form solution is obtained .
  it is found that the ratio of the stand-off distances of the shock
wave for the magnetic and nonmagnetic cases does not depend
explicitly on the magnetic parameter s (ratio of the ponderomotive
force to the free-stream inertia force) nor on the density ratio (the
value at the free stream divided by the value behind the shock
wave) but on the product s at least for values of between
and .
  the velocity gradient on the body is also calculated and the
ratio of the magnetic to the nonmagnetic case is shown to depend
on the parameter .
  the case of cylindrical shocks is also examined,. the same
general conclusions are drawn .

body under lifting wing .
  an investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations
composed of a cambered body positioned a certain distance
beneath an arbitrary lifting wing .  the geometry of the wing is
regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or
optimum .  expressions for the drag and lift are obtained from
reverse-flow considerations,. these greatly implement such a
study when interference cross flows must be cancelled .  the
drag advantage to be gained when a given body and wing
assume a given orientation is studied .  treated more extensively
is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing
incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and
length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed lift .
numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large
number of parameters appearing in the problem .  of these, the
gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly
important .  it is found that at low gap moderate body
distortions have a significant influence on the drag .  drag reductions
of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been
found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a
gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,
and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body .
comparison is made with the conventional wing-body
combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not
appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the
configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower
than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations .
  tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a
scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile
wing .  the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number
was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length .  it was found that the
measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the
body agrees very well with the theoretical value .  downstream
of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was
observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock
but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the
body of the shock-induced cross flow .  further observations
suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body
or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the
shock-induced cross flow .

nonsimilar solutions of the compressible laminar boundary
layer equations with applications to the upstream-transpiration
cooling problem .
  a new method is presented for predicting the boundary-layer
characteristics downstream of the porous region of an
injection-cooled surface .  the method consists of a general scheme for
obtaining nonsimilar solutions of the compressible-
laminar-boundary-layer equations and is formulated along the following
lines .  the viscous domain is divided into n curvilinear strips .
the governing equations are then integrated along the
coordinate normal to the body from the surface to the boundary of each
strip .  as a result, one obtains a set of independent
integro-differential relations .  the integration is carried out by
expressing the integrands as polynomials, the coefficients of which
are functions of the unknown values of the velocity and
temperature on the strip boundaries as well as of the imposed
boundary condition at the wall and at the outer edge .  after the
integration is performed, a set of ordinary first-order differential
equations is obtained .  the set of equations may be solved for
given initial conditions by a numerical integration scheme such
as the runge-kutta method .  several numerical examples of
interest are presented .

the turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablating
surfaces .
  incompressible turbulent-boundary-layer analysis is
extrapolated analytically to the case of a compressible turbulent
boundary layer with ablation or mass injection at the surface .
the effects of chemical reactions such as dissociation and
recombination as well as combustion are included .  the analysis
applies to blunt as well as sharp bodies which are either
axisymmetric or two-dimensional .  when the turbulent lewis and
prandtl numbers are unity, it is found that, as in the laminar
case, little detailed knowledge of the chemistry inside the
boundary layer is required in most instances .  the conditions at the
surface and the outer edge of the boundary layer are often
sufficient for prediction of heat and mass transfer .
  comparison is made with experiments on the combustion of
graphite under turbulent flow conditions .  prediction of ablation
rates within about 30 percent accuracy is obtained when
empirical constants obtained from incompressible velocity profiles
with no mass injection are used .

some considerations on the laminar stability of time-dependent basic
flows .
as a stability criterion for infinitesimal disturbances in an
incompressible, parallel but time-dependent basic flow, it is proposed
to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said
to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,
as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to
decrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed .
for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar
velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),
in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed to
reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  the
disturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or the
longitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizing
influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the
velocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of fales
rotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the deceleration .
at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the
stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further
shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration .
even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral
stability may not be used without reservation .  to calculate
momentary stability properly, a procedure for a slowly varying but more
general profile is also described .

  the supersonic boom in steady, level flight of a wing-body
configuration is due to the effects of body volume, wing volume,

contribution in the far field of each of these factors can, in any given
azimuthal plane, be represented as that of an equivalent body
of revolution .  this concept is developed to investigate the
possibilities of using interference among the components of a
wing-body configuration to reduce or suppress the boom due to

on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet .
  a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum
noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent
jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the /
quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound-
emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher
than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an
irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were
frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar
shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it .
  the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent
the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer .
acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as
transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/
or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is
visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of
geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in
transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic
waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in
ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at
speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium .
however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise
of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the
fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to
lighthill .
  those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect
to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer
are significantly modified by the viscous action through the
critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective
amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it .
kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream
emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation
significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power
output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions
augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as,
predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective
corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per
unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted
downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating
the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may
increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing
action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be
interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of
the shear-layer profiles .

discussed .  the conditions for simulating flows are noted .  crocco's

far from the tip is considered .  it is found that far from the tip

solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problems
by means of high-speed digital computers .
  the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximate
solution of the integral equation which represents the potential
flow about a finite wing, with no restrictions beyond those
necessary for linearization .  after assuming the usual series
representation of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solution
is achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of the
transformed integral equation by single and double fourier series and
performing termwise integrations analytically .  this is followed
by the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient
matrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at
selected control points .  in this procedure the number of control
point used is limited only by the storage capacity of the
computer .  control points may be located so as to cover the entire
wing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements,
permitting the accurate representation of complicated mean
surface shapes .
  an evaluation of the proposed method is included .
comparisons with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tank
results are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed
method when applied to plane wings .  a final evaluation
involves a comparison of calculated surface pressure distribution
with wind-tunnel measurements on a swept, tapered wing with
a cambered and twisted mean surface .  the agreement evidenced
in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy as
similar comparisons on plane wing planforms .  in either case,
the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracy
requirements for most aircraft design studies .

the supersonic boom of a projectile related to drag

  the whitham theory predicting the far-flow field around a
projectile is used to derive body shapes which produce extreme
bow shock-wave pressure jump or /boom,/ subject to
constraining conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock and
fineness ratio of the bodies .  it is found that the minimum drag
body is also the minimum boom body .  the body-volume effect
and the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridian
section on the boom intensity is investigated .
  as a general result of the investigation, it can be said that the
boom of a projectile for given mach number and flight altitude
is primarily determined by its length and fineness ratio .  the
maximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodies
with given length and fineness ratio is of the order of 10 per cent .
the geometry of the bodies is thus found to play a minor role .

.W
an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method .
  the problem is considered of calculating approximately the
inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a
smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing
edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the
assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for
the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic
shock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary
characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple
shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing
the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances
it may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic
variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then
formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock
shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the
special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is,
for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape
expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result
previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender
bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by
friedrichs .
  employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion
method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent
perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent
flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers
of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an
oblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those
regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to
taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected
in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and
reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary
conditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for
the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure
distribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals
involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the
method of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its
accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure
distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at
an infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are
compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available,
and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .

high-speed viscous corner flow .
  a boundary-layer integral method analysis is set up for
compressible laminar flow in a symmetric corner with varying angle
and streamwise pressure gradient .  it represents an extension
and modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskii
and bolshakov .  the analysis is applied to the case of constant
pressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, for
which the crocco velocity-enthalpy relation holds .  although
simplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outside
the 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends are
probably correct outside this range .  the limiting cases near 0
and 180 are not considered .
  favorable agreement between some results obtained by the
integral method and by other methods is demonstrated for the
isothermal, constant-density case .
  results show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermost
isovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increases .
this sharp merging of the outer isovels is increased by increasing
corner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaces .  within
the interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction of
the disturbed region of merging is influenced by surface
heat-transfer conditions .  surface shear and heat flux are decreased
in the disturbed region, and are zero at the apex .  for cases
corresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of wider
corner angles, the /specific momentum-area/ exhibits the same
decrease with mach number as its two-dimensional counterpart,
whereas the /specific displacement-area,/ a measure of
stream-tube dilation, increases more rapidly with mach number than
the comparable two-dimensional parameter .

viscous flow past a quarter infinite plate .
  a study is made of the motion of an incompressible viscous
fluid past a quarter-infinite plate, whose leading edge is
perpendicular to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbed
direction of the stream .  it is assumed that the kinematic
viscosity is small .  the first approximation is taken to be the
undisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtained
by iferation .  the second approximation is the blasius shear
layer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate .
in turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to the
plate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocities
are 0, to match with the conditions at infinity .  further,
the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must be
completed to 0 by introducing a secondary shear layer .  the
regions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,.
in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs special
care, because the determination of the chief terms is complicated
by the presence of powers of log .  in particular it is shown
that the effect of the edge is to change the skin-friction coefficient

on the approach to chemical and vibrational equilibrium
behind a strong normal shock wave .
  the concurrent approach to chemical and vibrational
equilibrium of a pure diatomic gas passing through a strong normal
shock wave is investigated .  it is demonstrated that the
equilibrium degree of dissociation behind the shock front, and hence the
density, for the case where the vibrational degrees of freedom are
frozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence the
density, for the case where all degrees of freedom are in
equilibrium .  thus the necessary condition for a maximum of the
density between the shock front and the position of full
equilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  the
sufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shown
to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees
of freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag
the approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,.
that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in
the respective relaxation times before such a maximum might be
observed .  an example calculation for a mach 13 strong shock
wave in oxygen illustrates the appearance of such a maximum of
the density and its dependency upon the relative values of the
vibration and dissociation relaxation times .

second-order theory for unsteady supersonic flow past
slender pointed bodies of revolution .
  an analysis is made of the second-order effects of thickness on
the unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender pointed body of
revolution in supersonic flow .  the theory is restricted to
harmonic oscillations for small angles of attack .  the solution is
obtained by approximating the nonlinear terms in the second-order
potential equation by their first-order values and solving the
resulting inhomogeneous partial differential equation, subject to
more refined boundary conditions .  the pressure equation is
likewise refined and integrated to give the second-order
corrections to lift and pitching moment coefficients .  the analysis can
be considered as an extension of the second-order, slender body
theory of lighthill to the case of unsteady flow .
  the results indicate appreciable reductions in unsteady lift
and damping moment coefficients when applied to slender cones .
the present theory is estimated to be reliable provided that
is less than 0.7 .

on the response of the laminar boundary layer to small

  the linearized treatment of small time-dependent disturbances
of a laminar boundary layer, initiated by lighthill, is extended in
several ways .  in particular, the high-frequency expansion is
continued beyond the leading (stokes) term .  several interesting
questions of /joining/ occur, which are discussed but left
unresolved .  in addition, a practical method for obtaining the
response to the laminar boundary layer to an impulsive change in
velocity is presented .  the methods are applied to the case in
which the basic steady flow belongs to the falkner and skan

a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent
boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions .
  a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent
boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which
permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than
the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general
character of the boundary layer .  the method offers the
simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts
rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled
differential equations required by existing methods .  the method also
affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total
boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as
well as the nondimensional velocity distribution .
the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two
regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall
and an outer region which is described by a function depicting
the deviation from that law .  the deviation function involves
two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the
skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical
purposes, can be considered a constant .  since the entire
velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent
upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the
generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region
of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream
conditions .
  agreement between experimental velocity distributions and
those calculated by the method presented here is generally very
good .  the analysis and calculation procedures which are
presented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two-
dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows .

turbulent heat transfer through a highly cooled, partially
dissociated boundary layer .
  the problem of heat transfer from high-temperature air
through a turbulent boundary layer to a cold surface is
considered both analytically and experimentally .  heat-transfer
data obtained in shock tubes are presented and correlated by a
semiempirical theory which includes the effect of atomic diffusion .
  the distinguishing characteristics of turbulent boundary
layers with dissociation and large cooling are considered .  it is
shown that the equations governing such flow, after certain
approximations, can be represented in a form similar to the
classical equations for a turbulent boundary layer .
  an approximate theory is proposed for turbulent heat transfer
for a highly cooled boundary layer on portions of the body where
the pressure gradient is negligible in the case of blunted bodies
of revolution in high-speed flight .
  experimental results obtained on the cylindrical portion of a
hemisphere-cylinder model are presented for conditions
simulating flight speeds to 21,350 ft. sec., where up to 30 per cent of
the molecules are dissociated .  reynolds numbers of 2.5 x 10,
based on local fluid properties external to the boundary layer,
were achieved .  the larger values of reynolds number and
flight speed were not obtained simultaneously, due to structural
limitations of the shock tubes,. however, the experiments were
conducted in such a way that the important effects of each could
be determined .
  in the experiments the mach number external to the
boundary layer varied between 1.7 and 2.2 .  the corresponding mach
number for blunted nonslender bodies in flight would have a
maximum value between 2.5 and 4,. however, it is shown that
these differences in mach number are not important for such
bodies .

boundary layer transition and heat transfer in shock
tubes .
  an experimental study is made of the wall boundary layer in a
shock tube operated over a wide range of shock mach numbers
and pressure levels in air, including those for which real-gas effects
exist .  transition distances are determined and correlated in
terms of the transition reynolds number based on a
characteristic length for this boundary layer .  data from independent
shock-tube studies are also included in this correlation .
  the results indicate a weak dependence of transition reynolds
number on shock strength up to moderate values of shock mach
number, followed by a larger stabilizing tendency .  comparison
of these data with transition data obtained in the same manner
in argon indicate that the increased cooling rates are largely
responsible for the stabilization .
  a dependence of transition reynolds number on the unit
reynolds number is found at the lower shock strengths .
specifically, higher transition reynolds numbers are achieved at
larger unit reynolds numbers .
  the phenomenon of transition reversal does not appear within
the range of the experiments reported .
  laminar- and turbulent-flow heat-transfer rates to the walls
of the shock tube are determined experimentally .  the results
of the heat-transfer measurements substantiate existing theories
in both the laminar- and turbulent-flow regimes .

on the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap including
jet-mixing effects .
  this paper is concerned with the thrust generated by a jet
flap .  it is shown that a /linear/ thrust hypothesis can be
obtained, provided linearized potential flow is assumed .  in fact,
the linearized problem of a jet-flap system is found to be the
linear combination of a lift problem and a thrust problem .  the
lift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to note
that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed by
the jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theory .
  the mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzed
by the momentum-integral method .  the analysis substantiates
stratford's suggestion for obtaining an increase of thrust by
causing the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of high
suction .  finally, some approximate formulas, relating the thrust
and the jet angle, are derived .  the drag of the airfoil section and
other viscous effects are, however, not considered .

stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heated

stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heated
boundary layer .
  it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes in
heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two
conceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat
transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain
distance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocity
and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance
determines the position of the propagating flame .  in the second
mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a
continuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot
recirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous
ignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is the
characteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines
the position of the flame .
  all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with
conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable .
in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show
under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides
the appropriate model and also how the two models are related .
to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to
study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over a
wall heated in the form of a step function .  with a turbulent
boundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., the
characteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproducible
variable .  these observations led to the conclusion that a
continuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated
turbulent boundary layers .  a rational explanation is made for the
transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable
in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar
boundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated
turbulent boundary layers .
  as a further verification of the continuous ignition mechanism
an apparent ignition energy was found .  the logarithm of the heat
added at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear function
of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature .  the activation
energy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreed
reasonably well with the estimated value for the fuel used .

natural frequency as a function of duct areas and volumes, and
damping ratio as a function of the slope of the steady-state mass

theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamics .
  a supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite
cylinder as a hub is studied .  the forward speed may be subsonic, but
the relative speed at each section is supersonic .  the lightly
loaded blades are represented by a surface distribution of
appropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary
supersonic thin-wing theory .  these sources are found by
approximating the exact potential for a constant-strength
compressible source traveling along a helical path .  the usual
relationship between the source strength and boundary condition is
found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the
appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry .
  tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard
and krasilshchikova .  the present investigation, however, is
restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears
off the tip .  for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained
through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the
upwash region off the tip .  by transforming to a curvilinear,
nonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach
lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral
equation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is
derived .  without having to solve this equation, it is shown that
the potential for a point in the tip region can be obtained in terms
of an integration of known source distributions over the blade
surface only .
  the case of a twisted flat plate of particular planform is treated,
and a sample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at
selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion
of the blade, as well as over the entire tip region .
  though this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic
propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary
derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles .

nonvanishing mean induced electric field strengths are solved in
terms of complimentary error functions as well as some
elementary functions .  it is shown that the solutions are reducible to
that of the steady case as the time approaches infinity, and to that
of the nonmagnetic field as the hartmann number becomes zero .
some numerical calculations are given .  the results indicate
that in the presence of a magnetic field the flow rate is reduced

sec. in the shock tube portion of the facility are presented . static

condition and the expansion process .

distributions, shock-wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs
of the luminous gas region in the shock layer . it is seen that the
shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures
due to the real gas effects . for the hemisphere the pressure
distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for
 all stagnation temperatures . for a 50degree cone-hemisphere the

a study of vortex cancellation .
  the cancellation of a vortex by means of another concentric
vortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated .  when
such a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure .
the vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional
airfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the
wake of the other .  the airfoils have opposite effective angles of
attack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as
required .
  it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum
angle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex
from the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of
the two airfoils .  a theoretical solution of this optimum angle of
attack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of
attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of
the wings .  the pressure recovery accompanying the vortex
cancellation is also studied .  theoretical considerations, based on
the model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube
show that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop
across the first airfoil can be recovered .  this maximum is
imposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the
irreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field .
experimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized .
  perhaps the primary value of the present study is the
opportunity it provides to verify certain of the fundamental concepts
of fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailing
vortex system of a lifting wing is cancelled by a second wing .

type, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flow .  the other type

step height times free-stream velocity squared divided by
kinematic velocity squared .  the burst type has been observed for
values of this parameter larger than 4.2 x 10 .  the separated

sublimation in a hypersonic environment .
  a priori knowledge of the response of materials subjected to a
severe aerothermal environment is essential in the space age .
the successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demands
that the fundamental problem of the interaction between a
material and dissociated air be properly formulated and solved .  in
this paper, the problem of sublimation in a hypersonic
environment is considered .
  in this study of hypersonic ablation, the pertinent
conservation equations are derived and the simultaneous processes of
diffusion, convection, and thermal exchange are analyzed for the
vaporization of a refractory material which is subjected to the
environmental conditions encountered during hypersonic
reentry .
  for simplicity, only the forward stagnation point of an axially
symmetric body is treated .  it is shown that the quantity,
called the effective heat of vaporization, which includes all heat
absorbing or heat blocking effects, is an increasing function of
flight speed, independent of body size, except where
nonequilibrium vaporization effects or radiative effects appear .

wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flow .
  it has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produce
minimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing
surface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced by
this distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is
constant over the wing surface .  this combined downwash can be
expressed by an integral which contains the load as a function
of the spanwise and chordwise coordinate .  the problem of
finding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the
problem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integral
equation .
  the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is
handled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an
approximate integration over interpolation polynomials .  the
chordwise load distribution is represented by a limited series
development in legendre polynomials .  the sigularity of the
kernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point
can be avoided by a similar legendre development of the
combined induced downwash which is constant .  the integral
equation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for the
unknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load
distribution at a limited number of spanwise stations .
  practical calculations are carried out on an electronic
computer .  the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the
local incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize this
distribution .  for many wing plan forms, considerable gains
over a plane wing appear possible .

turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in two-dimensional

  recent results obtained for three-dimensional laminar
boundary layers are extended to the turbulent case .  it is shown that
in the presence of highly cooled surfaces and of moderate mach
numbers of the outer stream, the crossflow and the pertaining
reynolds stresses in a general three-dimensional turbulent
boundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressure
gradients .  a correlation due to mager between two-
dimensional compressible and incompressible turbulent boundary
layers is extended to the problem in question .  from a study of
the transformation and of its implications, a rapid method for
the analysis of the boundary-layer flow under the subject
conditions is established .  in the absence of general three-
dimensional data, a comparison with experiments and with the
predictions of other known analyses is carried out for several
axisymmetric configurations,. the results of the method presented
here exhibit good agreement with the data .  the range of
validity of the cold wall approximation for general three-dimensional
problems is estimated qualitatively on the basis of recent
measurements in laminar flow, the argument being that, for either
zero or favorable streamwise pressure gradients, smaller
three-dimensional effects are to be expected in a turbulent boundary
layer, as compared to a laminar layer .

on shearing flow between porous coaxial cylinders .
  the flow between concentric porous cylinders in relative axial
motion with a pressure gradient is considered .  the analysis is
restricted by the assumption that the velocity distribution is a
function of the radial coordinate only so that there is no net
injection or withdrawal of fluid at any station .  this assumption
reduces the problem to a soluble system of ordinary differential
equations .  an associated heat-transfer problem is also discussed
briefly .

the transition to tubulence in a boundary layer on
a blunt cone in supersonic flow .
  experiments were made with a series of cones, each having an
included angle of 15 degrees, and having different tip radii (sharp
to blunt nose) .  the cones were tested in streams, undisturbed
mach numbers of 3.12 and 3.81, and the position of transition to
turbulence was observed with a shadowgraph technique .  for each
mach number the distance to transition (distance downstream from
the tip of the cone) increased with increase in tip radius, reached
a maximum at a certain tip radius, and then decreased with
increase in tip radius .  a study indicates that a reynolds number
based on the momentum thickness, instead of the length from tip to
transition, is a more appropriate parameter for correlating the data .
the research scientist active in this field probably would derive
the most benefit from the original paper .

  this paper describes the flexible
surfaces whose properties have
been examined and which have been tested on
an aerofoil in a wind tunnel .
the experiment has been rather inconclusive
as no drag reductions have been
found in turbulent flow, whilst the only
rearward movements of transition
occurred in conditions where the alteration
has been inhibited by the onset
of laminar separation .  the limitations of
the experiment are discussed
carefully in order to clarify the next steps
which are to be taken with

numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculation
of unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidal
gusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds .
  a numerical lifting-surface method has
been used to calculate direct gust
forces and moments on wings of several
planforms .  the gust velocities are
continuous and vary sinusoidally in the stream
direction and are also uniform across
the wing span .  the procedure has the
advantage of rapid machine calculation and
includes the effects of wing planform,
nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced flow
effects .  the method provides for calculation
of gust forces on a basis
consistent with that for the calculation of forces
due to motion and deformation .  the
results include the in-phase and quadrature
components of the following
quantities ..  (a) spanwise distribution of
section lift coefficient, (b) total
lift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-moment
coefficient .  in addition,
generalized gust forces on approximate fundamental
cantilever bending modes (
parabolic) are also included .  results have been
obtained for 60 and 75 delta wings,
ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspect
ratio 6.00 .  conditions for which
calculations were made include two mach numbers
reduced-frequency range of 0 to 1.0 .  the
direct gust forces and moments are in
forms suitable to be inserted in equations
of motion used in the calculation of
the dynamic responses of flexible lifting
vehicles to random turbulence and to be

  in order to investigate the

subsonic and transonic flutter study
has been conducted in air and in

planform employed had an aspect

a sting-mounted full-span model was
tested in addition to three sizes of
wall-mounted semispan models .  a wide
range of mass ratio was covered by
the tests in air and by flutter
calculations made by the modified
strip-analysis method of naca research
memorandum l57l10 .  a limited amount of
data was obtained in freon-12 .
  results of the tests in air
and in freon-12 are in good agreement
with the flutter calculations at
all mach numbers .  the test data
compare favorably with previously
published transonic flutter data for the
same wing planform .  the results
indicate that flutter characteristics
obtained in freon-12 may be interpreted
directly as equivalent flutter
data in air at the same mass ratio and mach number .

atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratios
modulated to limit decelerations .
  an analysis has been made of
atmosphere entries for which the
spacecraft lift-drag ratios were
modulated to limit the maximum
deceleration .  the parts of the drag polars
used during modulation were from
maximum lift coefficient to minimum
drag coefficient .  five drag polars
of different shapes were assumed for
the spacecraft .  the entries covered
wide ranges of initial velocity,
initial flight-path angle, initial
and maximum lift-drag ratio .
two-dimensional trajectory calculations were
made for a nonrotating, spherical
earth with an exponential atmosphere .
the results of the analysis indicate
for four of the five drag polars that,
relative to the maximum deceleration
of an unmodulated entry at maximum
lift-drag ratio, the greatest reduction
in maximum deceleration obtainable
by modulation depends upon a single
parameter .  this parameter is the ratio
of the value of the aerodynamic
resultant-force coefficient at minimum
drag coefficient to the value at
maximum lift coefficient .  thus, the
reduction in maximum deceleration
is independent of initial velocity,
initial flight-path angle, initial
maximum lift-drag ratio, and
the shape of the drag polar .  for
the fifth drag polar, the reduction in
maximum deceleration was found to
depend upon the maximum lift-drag ratio .
also, relative to the depth of a
given deceleration-limited corridor, the
greatest increase in corridor depth
obtainable by modulation (for four of
the five drag polars) depends upon
the same ratio of aerodynamic
resultant-force coefficients .  the fractional
increase in corridor depth can be
expressed as an empirically determined
analytical function of this ratio .

effect of jet pluming on the static stability of cone-cylinder-flare

  the effects of jet pluming on
normal force and pitching moment of
have been measured at a free-stream
mach number of 9.65 with reynolds
numbers based on model length of 500,000
to 600,000 .  geometric variables
included nose bluntness, flare half-angle,
and nozzle geometry and exit displacement .
two test nozzles with design
mach numbers of 3.74 and 4.60 were operated
with compressed air to
simulate the initial jet-boundary shape of a
particular solid-propellant
rocket motor operating between altitudes
of 165,000 and 215,000 feet .
the ratio of the jet pressure to free-stream
static pressure varied from
a jet-off condition to approximately 1,300
for the nozzle with design mach
number of 3.74, and from a jet-off condition
to approximately 280 for the
nozzle with design mach number of 4.60 .
the angle-of-attack range was
from 0 to approximately 6 .
  the results indicate that as the
jet-pressure ratio was increased
the size of the jet plume increased,
and as a result the model static
stability was decreased .  increasing
the angle of attack resulted in a
reduction in static instability during
the jet-on condition .  increasing
nose bluntness resulted in a more forward
movement of the center of
pressure when jet-plume interference was not
present and a rearward movement
in the center of pressure when jet
interference was present .  increasing
the nozzle-area expansion ratio and
displacing the nozzle exit downstream
of the flare base resulted in a more
rearward location of the center of
pressure .

  the matrix force method of redundant
structure analysis is currently
being extended by various users to cover
a number of non-linear problems .
one of these is the non-linear analysis
of heated cambered wings, such as
might be used in advanced flight vehicles .
in this case the approach used
by the present authors is equally applicable
to shallow shells, the
formulation of the strain-displacement and
equilibrium relations being a
finite element equivalent to that used
by marguerre .  the solution is
obtained by a combined iteration and step
by step procedure utilizing a
tangent flexibility matrix .  divergence
in the calculations indicates
that the range of stable configurations
has been exceeded .  cambered
plates subjected to several loadings are
given as examples,. for one, an
exact solution is available for comparison .
  it is believed that the basic concepts
involved in this shallow
shell analysis can be extended to apply
to other, more general shell
instability problems, and that useful
solutions to the latter are
probably within the capability of present day digital computers .

the study the general concepts shall be outlined briefly .  the
discussions of the recent developments are restricted to
inviscid flow problems only, neglecting viscosity, heat
conduction and diffusion .  particular attention is directed to recent
advances in analyses of nonequilibrium dissociating gas
flows .  in the hypersonic flight regime, high stagnation
enthalpies sufficient to cause dissociation are realized .  when
the time to reach equilibrium is comparable with the time it
takes for a fluid particle to pass through the flow, then there
exist regions of the flow field where nonequilibrium states are
encountered .  a brief survey of both the linear and the
nonlinear methods of treatment of these nonequilibrium flows,
including some new developments that have not appeared
elsewhere, will be presented .

of nonequilibrium processes qualitatively
resemble those reported earlier .  however, the freezing
process is complicated by the coupling of the
nitric oxide shuffle reactions with the dissociation-recombination
reactions .  in many cases of
hypersonic nozzle flows where the energy in nitrogen dissociation
is significant, the fast shuffle reactions
prevent nitrogen-atom freezing which would otherwise occur
if three-body recombination were the only
process operating .  nitric oxide concentrations
undershoot the equilibrium values if the ratio of
nitric oxide to oxygen molecule concentrations
exceeds unity in the freezing region .  this depletion
of nitric oxide leads to nitrogen-atom freezing .

.W
some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition
and heat transfer at supersonic speeds .
  large downstream movements of transition observed when the
leading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly
blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds
number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the
detached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction is
computed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 .
concurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur
in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar
boundary layer .
  the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is
substantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is
blunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the
downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to
the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or
leading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading
edge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with the
hollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 .
  application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields
the result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leading
edge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements of
transition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 3.0 to 30 at mach
the possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and friction
drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds .
  mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and
wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached
shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20 .  the dissipation and
stability of these profiles are discussed, and a method is
described for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce
the maximum possible downstream movement of transition .

compressible boundary layers on bodies of revolution .
  in a former paper (1) it has been shown that the
behaviour of the laminar boundary layer on a body of revolution can
be described mathematically by the same equations which are also
applied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in the
two-dimensional flow along a body contour, the form of which is
determined by the shape of the body of revolution .  a simple
relation exists between the two-dimensional boundary layers and
the axially symmetrical ones .  the flow had been assumed to be
incompressible .  in this report it shall be shown that this
relation is still valid when the compressibility is taken into
consideration .  the distribution of velocity as well as that of
temperature in the laminar boundary layer of a body of revolution
can be calculated by solving the corresponding problem for the
two-dimensional flow around a suitable contour .  the method is
made clear by the example of the supersonic flow towards a cone
tip,. this example has already been treated by another method
by hantzsche and wendt (2) .

the development of the boundary layer in supersonic
shear flow .
  the development of the boundary
layer in a velocity shear layer is
discussed for two-dimensional flow
and for axisymmetric flow of both
compressible and incompressible fluids .
it is shown that the solutions
obtained by li and glauert for the
two-dimensional flow of an
incompressible fluid are applicable in the
more general case after suitable
transformations of coordinates have
been made .  new definitions are shown
to be necessary, and are given, for
the displacement and momentum thicknesses
of such a boundary layer .  reynolds
numbers based on these thicknesses are
given, and it is shown that any phenomenon
which occurs at a constant value of such
a reynolds number will occur at a
point which, as the length scale of the
flow increases, first moves
down-stream and then moves slightly upstream .
this is shown to be in qualitative
agreement with experimental results on a
blunt cone in a supersonic flow .
a quantitative comparison of the theoretical
and experimental values of
displacement and momentum thicknesses is
attempted, and no disagreement is
obvious,. unfortunately the accuracy of the
experiments so far available is
insufficient to give positive confirmation
of the theory of this note .

  the cone is considered to be
moving at a velocity higher than that
of sound, so that there is in front
of it a shock wave, moving with the
same speed as the cone itself .  in
the first part of the paper, the case is
investigated mathematically where
the flow is irrotational, and the
pressure, velocity and density of the air
stream are each constant over the
surfaces of cones coaxial with the
moving solid cone .  the complete
solution is obtained in numerical
form, for cones of semi-vertical angle
of the paper, the results are compared
with experiment, both in respect of
pressure distribution as measured in a
wind tunnel, and also (for the 30
cone) by comparison with photographs
of bullets in flight .  in the latter case
the theory should only be applicable
if the speed is 1.46 or more times the
velocity of sound, and it is in fact
found in the photographs, that the nature
of the wave alters at about this
velocity .  the exact solution found, is
compared with an approximation
given recently by v. karman and moore .
this should be valid for thin
spindle-shaped bodies, and does in fact
agree well in the case of the cone
of 10 semi-vertical angle, but diverges
increasingly from the truth as

laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements at

cones at angles of attack up to 90 .
  two circular conical configurations
having 15 half-angles were
tested in laminar boundary layer at a
mach number of 6 and angles of
attack up to 90 .  one cone had a sharp
nose and a fineness ratio of
blunted nose with a bluntness ratio
of 0.1428 and a fineness ratio of 1.66 .
pressure measurements and
schlieren pictures of the flow showed
that near-conical flow existed up
to an angle of attack of approximately
near the base and the bow shock
wave was considerably curved .
  comparison of the results with
simply applied theories showed that
on the stagnation line pressures may
be predicted by newtonian theory,
and heat transfer by local yawed-cylinder
theory based on the yaw angle
of the windward generator and the local
radius of the cone .  base effects
increased the heat transfer in a region
extending forward approximately
circumferential pressure
distributions were higher than the
corresponding newtonian distribution
and a better prediction was obtained
by modifying the theory to match
the pressure at 90 from the windward

hypersonic flows past a yawed circular cone and other
pointed bodies .
a detailed treatment of inviscid hypersonic
flow past a circular cone is given, for
small and moderate yaw angles, within
the framework of shock-layer theory .
the basic problem of non-uniform validity
associated with the singularity of
the entropy field is examined and a valid
first-order solution is obtained which
provides an explicit description of a thin
vortical layer at the inner edge of the
shock layer .  analytic formulas for pressure
and circumferential velocity are
given consistent to the second-order
approximation including the non-linear
yaw effect .
  the study of the entropy field (which
is not restricted to the hypersonic case)
also provides corrections to previous
work on the yawed cone and confirms the
validity of the linear yaw effect on pressure
field in the stone theory .
  a related investigation of three-dimensional
flow fields is presented with
special reference to the flow structure near
the surface of a pointed, but
otherwise arbitrary body .  the inviscid streamline
pattern on the surface is given by
the geodesics originting from the pointed
nose as a leading approximation of
shock-layer theory .  associated with this
streamline pattern is a vortical sublayer
which exists generally at small as well as at
large angle of attack .  at the base of
the sublayer, enthalpy and flow speed remain

survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometrically
slender shapes .
  a survey is made of existing
theories for the calculation of pressure
distributions on slender bodies at
hypersonic speeds .  no account is taken
of boundary layer displacement effects
which are expected to become important
above a mach number of about 10 for a slender body .
  first the breakdown of linearised
supersonic theory is demonstrated as
mach number increases above about 5, and
this is followed by a derivation of
the hypersonic similarity rule .  this
section includes a description of the
piston-analogy .
  next a physical interpretation
of hypersonic flow is outlined and a
simple derivation of the modified
newtonian pressure formula is given .
  the equations of flow through
an oblique shock wave are simplified by
assuming a strong shock, and various
results are thereby derived .  these
include the tangent-wedge and tangent-cone formulae .
  this is followed by a description
of the newtonian approximation for
slender bodies, including the effect of
centrifugal forces, and the connection
with newtonian flow theory is emphasized for .
  the shock-expansion method is
described in some detail for both
two-and three-dimensional bodies, and
finally some remarks are made about the
available data sheets and tables for
estimating pressures on cones and
ogive-cylinders in yaw .
  the note does not claim to be
original, even in presentation .  the aim
has been to prepare a reasonably complete
survey of available theory for
hypersonic flow over slender bodies, excluding
viscous and explicit real gas effects .
  this will provide the background
for further work in which experimental
data will be analysed and in conjunction
with which it is hoped to produce
accurate design methods for estimating
pressures and forces on shapes intended
for sustained flight at hypersonic speeds .

.W
on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .
the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock
technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and
high-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to
disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from
 the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for
that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak
enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach
number, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to
remain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much
longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are
predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the
expansion wave originating at the diaphragm .
outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the
 arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first
disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately
 equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the
contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it
 appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation
are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a
heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for
further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the
multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end
 of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach
number . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected
disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in
 theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .
experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to
provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if
allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact
surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and
transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave
reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised
substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow
duration may result .
a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of
the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is
attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its
interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further
research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the
effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of
the tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion
wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that
the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a
severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock
mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow
duration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to
suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to
have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over
a range of shock mach number .
it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock
mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach
number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using
reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because
of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and
the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present
investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .
further research is required to check and extend the findings, and
topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .

temperature measurements of shock-waves by spectrum-line reversal, ii a
double beam method .
the sodium-line reversal method, as previously described, using a
photomultiplier and oscillograph, has been modified . two light beams
are now employed, and interference filters are used in front of the
photomultipliers instead of a spectrograph . in one beam the background
source is viewed directly, through the shock tube, and in the other beam
 the background source is viewed through the shock tube by a mirror
system with a neutral filter interposed to reduce its effective
brightness temperature . with a suitably chosen temperature for the
background, one oscillograph trace indicates absorption and the other
indicates emission of the sodium lines . it is thus possible, from the
records of a single shock, to determine the temperature history behind
the shock wave to about 20degreec . nitrogen and oxygen again show
relaxation effects near the front . temperatures in argon tend to come
low, owing to radiative disequilibrium,. excitation processes in argon
are discussed . with this system it is possible to determine
temperatures rather higher than that of the background source . some work has
also been done, with a single-beam method, using a carbon arc as
background and following reversal of the indium blue line . temperatures
 up to 3600degreek have been measured in shocks through nitrogen, but
the time resolution is not so good .

real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds .
a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate the
aerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable to
those encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering the
atmosphere . some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft/sec in
the shock tube portion of the facility are presented . static pressure
investigations were made in the nozzle for different stagnation
conditions in order to determine the flow condition and the expansion
process .
the results of the investigation on representative blunt bodies at
hypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up to
approximately 6000degreek are presented . these include body pressure
distributions, shock wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs
of the luminous gas region in the shock layer . it is seen that the
shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures
owing to the real gas effects . for the hemisphere the pressure
distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for
 all stagnation temperatures . for a 50degree cone-hemisphere the
pressure distribution and the shock wave detachment distance were
appreciably affected by the real gas effects .
the experimentally obtained shock wave shape and the approximate
boundary layer on a flat plate are correlated with the analytical
prediction . some preliminary results for the detached shock wave produced
by a blunt two-dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach number
of 19.6 are presented .

divergence of plate airfoils of low aspect ratio at
supersonic speeds .
  in part (1), as a first approach to a theoretical investigation
of low aspect ratio rectangular plate wings of constant thickness,
the two assumptions are made that ..  (a) the spanwise form of
the structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwise
distortion arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces are
approximations of the supersonic linearized theory .  the form of the
chordwise distortion is then deduced from the differential
equation representing the state of neutral equilibrium for small
displacements at the critical divergence speed .
  secondly, this problem is investigated using measured
structural flexibility coefficients together with theoretical
aerodynamic coefficients .
  thirdly, the usual series solution based on the rayleigh-ritz
approach is discussed, using the same assumptions as in the first
method .
  all the results of these methods are consistent and indicate that
the transonic regime at m = 1 is the most critical for
divergence .
  in part (2), it is established that sweeping the leading edge of
a plate airfoil of constant thickness increases its stability .  for
angles of sweep less than 30, the critical conditions occur when
the leading edge is sonic, but for angles greater than 30 the
critical conditions occur when m = 1 .

effects of a flexible boundary on hydrodynamic stability .
purpose of paper is to examine theoretically the use of coatings of
elastic materials to prevent transition from laminar to turbulent flow .
 theory is extension to flexible boundary of the small-disturbance
tollmien-schlichting stability theory and makes use of /tietjens
function/ and other functions that occur in solution of orr-sommerfeld
equation . it is shown how solutions for flexible wall can be obtained
from solutions for rigid boundary .
outline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stability
 theory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundary . theory
is given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexible boundary .
 behavior of flexible medium itself is also examined .
practical requirements are discussed . for example, a conclusion is that
 to avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surface
 waves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wave
 velocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting waves .
 moreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves from
developing but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves are
permissable . author states that a boundary that is both soft and light,
one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure of
 the flow, may be practical for use at high speeds . this surface should
 have a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instability
and a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface wave
instability . although paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it gives
comprehensive coverage of stability of laminar flow over a flexible wall .

qualitiative solutions of the stability equation for a boundary layer in
 contact with various forms of flexible surface .
an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation is
developed for the condition where the fluid is in contact with an
isotropic and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate
analytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at
least qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral
oscillations . in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as
nondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free
 of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treated
as that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid .
the results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surface
introduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillation
schlichting waves . most of these modes have speeds of propagation
determined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their
presence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flow
stability -dash a subject not treated here . the tollmien-schlichting
mode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the
surface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper
limit as well . indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low
rigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this mode
altogether, only at the expense, however, of the introduction of a mode of
flexural waves .

experiments on the use of suction through perforated
strips for maintaining laminar flow . transition and

  wind-tunnel tests are described in which suction
is applied at perforated strips, as an alternative to
porous strips or slots, in order to maintain a laminar boundary
layer .  a test was first carried out on a single row of
perforations on a cambered plate, as a preliminary to the main
tests which were performed on strips of multiple rows
of perforations drilled through the surface of a low-drag-type
aerofoil 13 per cent thick and of 5-ft chord .
  up to a wind speed of 180 ft sec it has been ascertained that
suction may be safely applied to extend laminar flow
provided the ratio of hole diameter to boundary-layer displacement
thickness is less than 2, the ratio of hole pitch to
diameter is less than 3 and there are at least three rows of holes
in the strip .  with less than three rows, the criteria
are much more restrictive .  it is possible to extend laminar flow
by suction through perforations whose diameters and
pitches exceed these values slightly, but only with the risk that
excessive suction quantities will produce wedges of
turbulent boundary layer originating at the holes .
  a uniform distribution of suction through the holes was
necessary .  this was successfully obtained by two methods,
the use of cells and throttle holes, and with tapered holes .
in particular, tests were carried out on some panels
supplied by handley page, ltd., in which the cells and tapered
holes had been constructed by commercial methods, and
the suction distribution proved satisfactory .
  the resistance of some of the cellular arrangements was
measured .  it was found that when the suction quantities
were the minimum required to maintain laminar flow, the
additional losses in total head of the sucked air due to
the resistance of the throttle holes could be made small compared
with the loss in total head of the sucked boundary
layer .

  within the framework of linearized

developed .  the equivalence between
the fluid mass source and heat
source was first noticed by hicks(2)

magnetohydrodynamical body forces can be computed .
  examples for a two-dimensional

the efficiency of lift or thrust
production by surface heat addition is

supersonic speeds the efficiency is

configuration .  it is found that
the efficiency of lift or thrust production

on some fourier transforms in the theory of non-stationary

  the growth of lift on a airfoil
starting impulsively from rest to a uniform
velocity has been given by wagner (1925) .  the
steady-state lift due to circulation on an
airfoil oscillating sinusoidally and moving with
uniform velocity has been given by theodorsen
  the present paper based essentially on the
material of n. a. c. a. report no. 629 by the
author, discusses some reciprocal relations of
the nature of fourier transforms existing
between the functions of wagner and theodorsen .
kussner (1936) has already shown that wagner's
function may be derived from theodorsen's
function .  by means of a superposition principle it
is possible to utilize these fundamental
functions to treat general problems in transient
expression which is accurate to within 2
percent is given for wagner's function .  this
expression leads to a good approximate expression
for theodorsen's function in terms of the
exponential integral, instead of hankel functions .
an analogy is drawn between transient
hydrodynamic flows and transient electrical flows .
  kussner (1936) has introduced a function
describing the growth of lift on an airfoil
entering a sharp edged vertical gust region .  this
function bears a certain relation to wagner's
function which is briefly discussed .

aerodynamic forces on wings in non-uniform motion .
  the problem of determining the aerodynamic forces
acting on wings of finite span in non-uniform motion
in an incompressible, inviscid fluid is investigated .  the underlying
theory is outlined in 2, and some known results
for the case of an aerofoil of infinite span are included in 3 .  it is
shown in 4, by the use of operational methods,
that the growth of lift function k (s) corresponding to a sudden unit
change of incidence can be derived from the lift
function corresponding to simple harmonic translational motion .
from results given by the writer for rectangular
wings (1943) and tapered wings (1945) in simple harmonic motion
the corresponding values of k (s) are determined .
the growth of lift function k (s) for a wing penetrating a uniform
vertical gust can then be estimated as shown in 4
and 5 .  by the use of approximate formulae for the growth of lift
curves given in fig. 2, the aerodynamic forces
corresponding to damped and growing translational oscillations are
derived .
  certain integrals involved in the theory are evaluated in
appendix 1, and in appendix 2 the method of determining
k (s), when k (s) is known, is discussed in detail .
  it is suggested that the aerodynamic forces acting on wings
of finite span for any type of motion can best be derived
from a knowledge of the forces corresponding to purely
divergent motion, which can be calculated by the methods
outlined in this report .

use of freon-12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing .
  the thermodynamic properties
of freon-12 have been
investigated to determine the
possibilities of the use
of this gas as a fluid for
aerodynamic testing .  the
values of velocity of sound
in freon-12, which are less
than one-half those in air,
are presented as functions
of temperatures and pressure,
including measurements at
room temperature .  the density
of freon-12 is about
four times that of air .  changes
in state of freon-12
may be predicted by means of the
ideal gas law with an
accuracy of better than 1 percent
at pressures below
freon-12 is shown not
to condense during an adiabatic
expansion from normal
conditions up to a mach number
of 3 .  the values of the
ratio of specific heats
for freon-12 are lower than
that for air, and therefore
an additional parameter is
introduced, which must be
considered when comparisons
are made of aerodynamic tests
using freon-12 with those
using air .
  the time lag of the
vibrational heat capacity
of freon-12 to a change in
temperature has been
measured and found to be
of the order of 2 x 10 second
at atmospheric temperature
and pressure .  this time
is so short that no important

studies of the use of freon-12 as a wind tunnel testing

  a number of studies relating to
the use of freon-12 as a
substitute medium for air in aerodynamic
testing have been made .  the
use of freon-12 instead of air makes
possible large savings in
wind-tunnel drive power .  because of the
fact that the ratio of specific
heats is approximately 1.13 for freon-12
as compared with 1.4 for air,
some differences exist between data
obtained in freon-12 and in air .
methods for predicting aerodynamic
characteristics of bodies in air
from data obtained in freon-12, however,
have been developed from the
concept of similarity of the streamline
pattern .  these methods,
derived from consideration of two-dimensional
flows, provide substantial
agreement in all cases for which comparative
data are available .  these
data consist of measurements throughout
a range of mach number from
approximately 0.4 to 1.2 of pressure
distributions and hinge moments on
swept and unswept wings having aspect
ratios ranging from 4.0 to 9.0,
including cases where a substantial

and compressibility in their relation to sweep has not been made
experimentally but some combined effects are given .  a

variation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed to
 a calculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected by
center-of-gravity location . however, for mach numbers from 1.0 to 1.35, there

calculation of flutter characteristics for finite-span swept or unswept
wings at subsonic and supersonic speeds by a modified strip analysis .
a method has been developed for calculating flutter characteristics of
finite-span swept or unswept wings at subsonic and supersonic speeds .
the method is basically a rayleigh type analysis and is illustrated with
 uncoupled vibration modes although coupled modes can be used . the
aerodynamic loadings are based on distributions of section lift-curve
slope and local aerodynamic center calculated from three-dimensional
steady-flow theory . these distributions are used in conjunction with
the /effective/ angle-of-attack distribution resulting from each of the
assumed vibration modes in order to obtain values of section lift and
pitching moment . circulation functions modified on the basis of
loadings for two-dimensional airfoils oscillating in a compressible flow are
 employed to account for the effects of oscillatory motion on the
magnitudes and phase angles of the lift and moment vectors .
flutter characteristics have been calculated by this method for 12 wings
 of varying sweep angle, aspect ratio, taper ratio, and center-
of-gravity position at mach numbers from 0 to as high as 1.75 . comparisons
 of the results with experimental flutter data indicate that this method
 gives generally good flutter results for a broad range of wings .

the calculation of aerodynamic loading on surfaces of any shape .
the object of the report is to establish a routine method for the
calculation of aerodynamic loads on wings of arbitrary shape . the method
developed is based on potential theory and uses a general mathematical
formula for continuous loading on a wing which is equivalent to a double
 fourier series with unknown coefficients . in order to evaluate the
unknown coefficients the continuous loading is split up into a regular
pattern of horseshoe vortices, the strengths of which are proportional
to the unknown coefficients and to standard factors which are given in a
 table . the total downwash at chosen pivotal points is obtained by
summing the downwashes due to the individual vortices, a process which
is simplified by the use of specially prepared tables of the properties
of the horseshoe vortex . by equating the downwash to the slope of the
wing at each pivotal point, simultaneous equations are obtained, the
solution of which defines the unknown coefficients .
the first layout involves a total of 76 vortices over the wing, and a
second layout, involving a total of 84, is shown to be of superior
accuracy . the effect on the solution of the number of pivotal points is
 investigated and it is concluded that by a suitable choice, it is
unnecessary to use a large number . results for a rectangular wing at

errors in published results in at least one of these cases . immediate
development includes the application to the calculation of the
characteristics of actual sweptback wings, including rotary derivatives, and

formulas for the supersonic loading, lift and drag
of flat swept back wings with leading edges behind
the mach lines .
  the method of superposition of linearized conical flows has
been applied to the calculation of the aerodynamic properties, in
supersonic flight, of thin flat, swept-back wings at an angle of
attack .  the wings are assumed to have rectilinear plan forms,
with tips parallel to the stream, and to taper in the conventional
sense .  the investigation covers the moderately supersonic speed
range where the mach lines from the leading-edge apex lie ahead
of the wing .  the trailing edge may lie ahead of or behind the
mach lines from its apex .  the case in which the mach cone
from one tip intersects the other tip is not treated .
  formulas are obtained for the load distribution, the total lift,
and the drag due to lift .  for the cases in which the trailing edge
is outside the mach cone from its apex (supersonic trailing edge),
the formulas are complete .  for the wing with both leading and
trailing edges behind their respective mach lines, a degree of
approximation is necessary .  it has been found possible to give
practical formulas which permit the total lift and drag to be
calculated to within 2 or 3 percent of the accurate
linearized-theory value .  the local lift can be determined accurately over
most of the wing, but the trailing-edge-tip region is treated only
approximately .
  charts of some of the functions derived are included to
facilitate computing, and several examples are worked out in outline .

atmospheric entries with vehicle lift-drag ratio modulated

  an analysis has been made of
atmosphere entries for which the
vehicle lift-drag ratio was modulated
to maintain specified maximum
decelerations and or maximum deceleration
rates .  the part of the
vehicle drag polar used during modulation
was from maximum lift
coefficient to minimum drag coefficient .  the
entries were at parabolic velocity
and the vehicle maximum lift-drag ratio
was 0.5 .  two-dimensional
trajectory calculations were made for a
nonrotating, spherical earth with an
exponential atmosphere .  the results
of the analysis indicate that for a
given initial flight-path angle,
modulation generally resulted in a
reduction of the maximum deceleration
to 60 percent of the unmodulated value or
a reduction of maximum deceleration
rate to less than 50 percent of the
unmodulated rate .  these results were
equivalent, for a maximum
deceleration of 10g, to lowering the undershoot
boundary 24 miles with a resulting
decrease in total convective heating to
the stagnation point of 22 percent .
however, the maximum convective heating
rate was increased 18 percent,. the
maximum radiative heating rate and total
radiative heating were each
increased about 10 percent .

the use of aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's

  by employing aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's
atmosphere at either orbital or /escape/ velocity, the range of
allowable entry angles for a prescribed peak deceleration is
greatly increased, while the total heat energy transferred to the
vehicle can be held to about the same value as for a nonlifting
vehicle .  only modest lift-drag ratios are required beyond peak g
to prevent the deceleration from exceeding the peak value, or to
prevent the vehicle from skipping out of the earth's atmosphere .
thus, the difficult guidance and control problem is greatly
alleviated,. in particular, for return from the moon or other

capability offers the possibility of sizable loading reductions or,

approximate analysis of atmospheric entry corridors

  a simple closed-form solution
for the achievable corridor depths
and entry angles as a function of
g-load limit, entry velocity, and
vehicle aerodynamics and thermodynamics
is developed for two modes of
vehicle operation, constant angle
of attack and modulated angle of attack .
  for constant angle of attack,
operation at maximum negative lift
coefficient on the overshoot bound,
and at an angle of attack between
zero and that for maximum lift-drag
ratio on the undershoot bound, gives
the deepest corridor .  for modulated
angle of attack, operating at
maximum negative lift coefficient on the
overshoot bound and modulating
the angle of attack from maximum
positive lift coefficient to zero on
the undershoot bound give the deepest
corridor .  the modulated angle of
attack gives corridor depths two to
four times larger than the fixed
angle of attack .  for both cases the
corridor depth is increased by
increasing maximum lift-drag ratio,
increasing g limit, and decreasing
entry velocity .
  consideration of hot-gas radiation
places a limit on the maximum
angle of attack for either mode of
operation .  if a maximum free-stream
reynolds number limit must be placed
on the vehicle to ensure a laminar
boundary layer, the deep atmospheric
penetrations associated with
configurations with high lift-drag ratio
may be ruled out .  both of these
thermodynamic considerations reduce
the acceptable corridor depth below

considerations alone .

  an investigation has been

hypersonic tunnel at a free-stream
mach number of 6.86 to determine
the jet-interference effects at
high jet-static-pressure ratios on the
stability and control of a
research-type airplane configuration .
compressed-air tests with a jet
exhausting from the base of the
fuselage were conducted over a reynolds
number range of 0.57 x 10 to
and over a jet-static-
pressure-ratio range of 0 to 1460 .  the results
of these tests indicated that
the operation of the jet induced a
sizable separated-flow region over
the vertical- and horizontal-tail
surfaces which could be approximately
duplicated at low angles of attack
by use of metal jet-boundary
simulators .  the results of force tests,
during which these metal
jet-boundary simulators were used,
indicated that this separated-flow
region caused a large reduction in
the longitudinal stability and
control and a smaller reduction in the
lateral and directional stability
and control .  by extending the
divergent section of the nozzle and thus
reducing the jet-static-pressure
ratio, these losses were diminished .

aerodynamic investigation of a parabolic body of revolution
at mach number of 1. 92 and some effects of an annular
supersonic jet exhausting from the base .
  an aerodynamic investigation
of a parabolic body of revolution was
conducted at a mach number of 1.92
with and without an annular supersonic
jet exhausting from the base .
measurements with the jet inoperative were
made of lift, drag, pitching moment,
radial and longitudinal pressure
distributions, and base pressures .
with the jet in operation,
measurements were made of the pressures
over the rear of the body with the
primary variables being angle of attack,
ratio of jet velocity to
freestream velocity, and ratio of jet
pressure to stream pressure .
  the results with the jet inoperative
showed that the radial
pressures over the body varied appreciably
from the distribution generally
employed in most approximate theories .
the linearized solutions for lift,
pitching moment, and center of pressure
gave relatively poor predictions
of the experimental results .  an analysis
of several theoretical methods
for calculating pressure distribution and
wave drag showed that some
methods gave results in considerable
disagreement with experimental values .
  maximum effects of the jet were
obtained at the lower ratio of jet
velocity to stream velocity and the
highest ratio of jet pressure to
stream pressure .  these effects amounted
to a slight decrease in
fore-drag, a reduction in lift, and a shift
of center of pressure in a
destabilizing direction .

boundary layer displacement effects in air at mach

  measurements are presented for pressure
gradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on a
flat plate in air at a mach number of 9.6 and for the
drag of thin wings at a mach number of about 6.8
and zero angle of attack .  the pressure
measurements at a mach number of 9.6 were made in the
presence of substantial heat transfer from the
boundary layer to the plate surface .  the measured
pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was
predicted with good accuracy by a modification to
insulated-plate displacement theory which allows
for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature
gradient along the surface on the boundary-layer
displacement thickness .
  the total drag of thin wings with square and delta
plan forms was measured at a nominal mach number
of 6.8 over a reasonably wide range of reynolds
numbers .  the total drag was found to be greater
than can be explained by adding a classical value of
laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag .
the difference is, in general, explained by the
increase in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by
the boundary-layer-induced pressures .

secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock

.W
secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock
layers .
  when a ramp or other compression
surface is located in a locally
supersonic region behind a hypersonic
bow shock wave, it generates a
secondary shock wave .  the ramp flow
disturbance may be viewed as an
embedded newtonian impact flow if the
embedded shock layer is thin .
examination of the applicability of newtonian
flow theory to cones and wedges
in uniform streams suggests that this
theory can be expected to give a
useful approximation to the surface
pressures .
  a pressure equation based on this
concept predicts a number of
interesting things ..  first, pressures
can differ from simple newtonian
theory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. for
example, on flare stabilizers on
blunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressures
are lower than newtonian and diminish
with increasing flight speed in the
hypersonic speed range .  the calculated
pressures vary over the flare surface
as a result of the nonuniformity of
its incident stream, and depend on the
axial location of the flare .  in
the case of a flap mounted on a
large-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressure
coefficients vary from 1 to 5 through
the variable entropy layer .  a
pressure coefficient of 5 greater than
the maximum possible in newtonian
flow can occur because the compression
process is more efficient than a
single shock wave process .  on areas
of the flap that protrude through
the main bow wave, the pressure
coefficient should revert to the simple
newtonian value .
  equations are developed for the
initial slopes of the normal-force
and pitching-moment curves of a flare
stabilizer .  in the simplest case
these differ from conventional newtonian
theory by the ratio of local
dynamic pressure to free-stream dynamic
pressure .  this ratio takes values
as low as 0.1 in some of the examples considered .

large deflections of structures subjected to heating

  the method of direct formulation of the stiffness matrix is
extended to include the effects of nonuniform heating and large
deflections .  the purpose is to develop an analytical tool for the
treatment of actual structures .
  in the solution of aeroelastic problems the relations between
forces and deflections must be determined .  the usual stiffness
matrix formulation of this relationship is limited to small
temperature changes and small deflections .  for large temperature
changes additional terms are required .  also the problem
becomes geometrically nonlinear when large deflections are
involved .  to overcome the inherent difficulties of the nonlinear
problem for practical structures either an iterative or a step-
by-step procedure must be used .  the force-deformation relations
necessary for this step-by-step or iterative approach are derived
for an axially loaded member and for a plate element including
the effects of thermal strains .

an experimental investigation of the interaction between shock waves and

an account is given of an investigation into the interaction between the
 boundary layer on a flat plate and a shock wave produced either
externally, by a wedge in the supersonic mainstream, or from within the
boundary layer, by a wedge held in contact with the plate . a wide range
 of free-stream mach numbers, boundary-layer reynolds numbers, and shock
 strengths has been covered, shock strength being defined as the ratio
of the static pressure downstream of the shock to the static pressure
upstream of it . variations in these parameters can have large effects
on the interaction, and there are also large differences between cases
with externally generated shocks and cases where the shock is generated
from within the boundary layer . the investigation has thrown light on
the physical mechanisms involved . it is found that many of the major
features of the interaction arise because the boundary layer separates
from the surface ahead of the shock wave . the conditions under which
separation occurs and the behaviour of the separated boundary layer thus
 have important effects, in terms of which, for example, the differences
 between the interactions observed with laminar and with turbulent
boundary layers may be explained .

approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer .
  after analyzing a large class of boundary-layer
velocity-profiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) and
h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other
over the whole range of positive and negative pressure
gradients .  here l, m and h are defined by
being the
velocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at the
edge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement
and momentum thickness, respectively .  based on this
discovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing
two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable
boundary-layer flows found in practice .  once these are
chosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the
form, v being the kinematic
viscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically .  as

of stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, which
yeilds a nonlinear set of two first-order differential equations .
these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless
parameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer,
and the transformed free-stream velocity .  thwaites' concept
of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed .
the evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizing
exact solutions recently obtained .
  with the resulting relations, methods are derived for the

problem by applying the two-dimensional fourier

with the result of the blasius solution .  from this
the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to
use a velocity other than in the linearization of the
equations of motion and suggest replacing by where .
this choice does not affect the solution far from
the plate but gives on the plate and in
comparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35 .
the solution of the modified oseen equation with this value
of c then seems acceptable as the approximate solution in
the region intermediate between the stokes flow and the
free stream .  on the basis of these considerations, the authors
suggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exact

axisymmetric free mixing with swirl .
  viscous laminar axially-symmetric
free-mixing with small, moderate,
and large swirl is investigated by a
boundary layer type of analysis with
integral methods .  moderate and small
swirls are formally the same,
differing only in the order of their associated
radial pressure gradients .  neither
induces significant axial pressure gradients,.
consequently their effect on the
axial flow is negligible .  for moderate and
small swirl an interesting feature
is the swirl decay .  in both compressible
and incompressible flow, it is
shown that jet swirl decays more rapidly
than wake swirl whereas both swirls
decay more rapidly than the non-uniformity
in axial velocity .  large swirl
generates axial pressure gradients as well
as large radial pressure gradients,
and therefore alters the streamwise flow .
examples calculated for
incompressible flow, show that the wake is
lengthened by large swirl .  it is
expected that this effect will be diminished
in the presence of higher free-stream
mach numbers which lead to decreased
densities, due to decreased
centrifugal effects, decreased radial pressure
gradients, and decreased axial
pressure gradients .

on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presence
of initial boundary layer .
recent experimental results have shown that the
mixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocity
ratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classical
eddy-viscosity theory .  the theoretical analysis of two uniform
streams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity,
performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and
prandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing will
take place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding to
laminar diffusion .  it has been suggested that the difference
between analysis and experiment could be attributed to the
presence of a boundary layer in the experiments .  it is the
purpose of this note to show that the use of the classical
eddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer,
is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed
physically .  instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be
explained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, as
was suggested in ref. 1 .  these conclusions are obtained
through application of the analysis presented briefly below .

nose drag in free-molecule flow and its minimization .
  the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free-molecule
flow involves two parameters ..  the speed ratio s between
ordered and random molecular motions (modified mach
number), and the temperature ratio between the solid surface
and undisturbed gas .  simplifications of the drag formula are
obtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremes .  to
minimize the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius,
the ordinary method of calculus of variation was found
inadequate .  a generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed,
and the specification of end conditions is discussed at length .
  results of the present investigation indicate that in all cases
an optimum nose requires a flat tip .  the optimum nose curve
for the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperature
ratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in the
following manner ..  for a hot body the curve is convex,. for a cold body,
concave .  an optimum solution exists in a restricted range of
specification only .  with prescribed tip and base radii the
admissible nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonic
and low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case of
low-subsonic cold body .  a vanishing tip radius leads to an
infinitely long nose in the former and a vanishing nose in the latter
case .
  optimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at the
low-subsonic extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, are
presented .  it is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with,
the hot-body solution asymptotically approaches
the hypersonic solution--i.e., a slender conventional warhead
with a flat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solution
asymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e.,
tip radius, a flat disc .

.W
an approximate solution for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar
compressible fluid .
an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the
linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation,
is presented .  the method is employed to determine the velocity field
associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible
gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate
solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical
calculation of pai .
in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the
assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be
obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by
resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more
recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate
solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this
method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an
essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of
reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives
accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely
the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the
convective operator in the original partial differential equation
is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the
boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be
treated by well-known techniques .
it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this
procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the
axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but
constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the
von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous
term, rather than the linearization of the convective term . pai's
problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique,
is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .

the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds .
the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well
known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a
great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane .
aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one
component of the grand compromise that a completed
airplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag
ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind
tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft
have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true
that the requirements of stability and control, structure,
and flight operation all contribute to reducing the
design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values
which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic
theory .  if, however, a certain range or operating
efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum
if we examine the range equation we see that range is
proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive
efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final
weight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a
linear factor in the range equation indicates that every
attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,
the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange
and unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such
configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of
their geometry on the weight ratios .  in the present
paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio
problem for conventional configurations having a wing
and a body in close proximity to each other .  no attempt
will be made to select a particular configuration
as being the best .  however, the promising direction
to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with
the understanding that the other factors may outweight
the aerodynamics .

effect of mach number on boundary layer transition
in the presence of pressure rise and surface roughness
on an ogive-cylinder body with cold wall conditions .
  the effect of mach number variation
from 1.8 to 7.4 on boundary-layer
transition was investigated on a slender
fin-stabilized ogive-cylinder
body in free flight at a constant length
reynolds number of 13.8 million .
the wall to free-stream temperature ratio
was constant at a value of 1.0
below mach number 4.5 and at a value of
of the test showed that increasing mach
number had a very favorable effect
of increasing the extent of the laminar
boundary layer for a given surface
roughness .  the transition data, when
plotted as a function of a factor
indicative of heat transfer, showed that
heat transfer was possibly
responsible for a good deal of the increase in
transition reynolds number with
mach number .
  transition was found to occur
farther forward on the sheltered side
of the body than on the windward side
for angles of attack as low as 0.4
and for all mach numbers .  the pressure
rise along sheltered-side
stream-lines was examined and it was found
that the pressure-rise coefficient
at the transition point, showed no
variation with mach number .  data from
other sources for different test
conditions, when reduced to values of
pressure-rise coefficient, were also
found to correlate well with that of
the present investigation with the
exception of data at low subsonic mach
numbers .  these present results also
show that mach number, surface
roughness, pressure rise, and length reynolds
number all affected boundary-layer
transition in the region of theoretical
infinite laminar stability to
small two-dimensional disturbances as
calculated for a flat plate with
zero pressure gradient .

the solution of the equations of the laminar boundary
layer for schubauer's observed pressure distribution
for an elliptic cylinder .
  the solution of the equations of the laminar
boundary layer has been carried out for the pressure
distribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96 ..  1 with
its major axis in the direction of the incident stream .
the solution has been obtained by the method of hartree and
womersley .  in applying this method the derivatives
parallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, so
that the partial differential equation of the boundary
layer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocity
distribution through the boundary layer at one section
to that at another, at an interval upstream .  by two independent
integrations covering the same range by finite intervals
of different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errors
involved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences,
and so to correct for these errors .
  the process of solution requires the values of the pressure
gradient along the solid boundary, and there is a certain
tolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distribution
from a limited number of observed values of pressure .
an analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, and
the results were used for the main solution calculated .
it is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradient
so derived, does not give separation of the boundary
layer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separate .
  it is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive to
the pressure distribution, and a comparatively small
modification of the pressure distribution gives a solution which
does indicate separation close to the point at which
separation is observed to occur .  the solution with this pressure
distribution also gives very good agreement with the
observed velocity distribution through the boundary layer at
points upstream from separation .

on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separation .
  the paper presents a mathematical discussion of the
laminar boundary layer, which was developed with a view
of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers
in particular for which the phenomenon of separation
occurs .  the treatment starts with a slight modification of
the form of the boundary layer equation first published by
von mises .  two approximate solutions of this equation
are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the
boundary layer while the other is exact at the wall .  the
final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions
at the inflection points of the velocity profiles .  the final
solution is given in terms of a series of universal functions
for a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributions
outside of the boundary layer .  detailed calculations of
the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the
case in which the potential velocity is a linear function of
the distance from the upstream stagnation point .  finally
the complete separation point characteristics are
determined for the boundary layer associated with a potential
velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of
the distance from the stagnation point .  it appears that
extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex
potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using
the explicit formulae given in the paper .

was felt as to the accuracy with which the well-known
pohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in the
neighborhood of such a separation point .  numerical
calculations were carried out for certain cases involving
theoretical simplifications, and very considerable
discrepancies were found between the results of the new
and pohlhausen methods .  the method was also used
in developing a theory for the maximum lift coefficient
of certain classes of airfoils .  this theory gave

  the speed distribution in a laminar boundary layer on
the surface of an elliptic cylinder, of major and minor
axes 11.78 and 3.98 inches, respectively, has been
determined by means of a hot-wire anemometer .  the direction
of the impinging air stream was parallel to the major axis .
special attention was given to the speed distribution in
the region of separation and to the exact location of the
point of separation .  an approximate method, developed
by k. pohlhausen for computing the speed distribution,
the thickness of the layer, and the point of separation, is
described in detail,. and speed-distribution curves
calculated by this method are presented for comparison with
experiment .  good agreement is obtained along the
forward part of the cylinder, but pohlhausen's method fails
shortly before the separation point is reached and
consequently cannot be used to locate this point .
  the work was carried out at the national bureau of

  a survey of integral methods in laminar-boundary-layer
analysis is first given .  a simple and sufficiently accurate
method for practical purposes of calculating the properties
layer in an axial pressure gradient with heat transfer at the
wall is then presented .  for flow over a flat plate, the method
is applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution of
temperature along the surface and for any given constant
prandtl number close to unity .  for flow in a pressure gradient,
the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniform

pressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform wall
temperature is developed .  the analysis is based on an extension of

higher degree velocity and stagnation-enthalpy profiles .  from
the equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect of
pressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on the

the buckling of a square panel under shear, when one

  reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design
of spar with thin sheet web it is important to know
the load which will just cause the web to buckle .  as stiffeners
divide the web into panels, it is required to find the
buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by
spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners .
boundary conditions which represent closely this type of edge
fixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple support
critical shear stress for a square panel held in this way .
  conclusions and further development.--it is found that the
value of the critical shear stress is almost midway between
its values when all four edges are clamped and all four edges
are simply supported .
  the method of solution developed in this report is of very
general application, and can be used to investigate the
stability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination
of shear and compression or tension, and the edges
are clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped
or all simply supported .  by an easy extension the
method of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse
vibration of rectangular panels for the same types
of loading and edge fixing .

  this article proposes a new method for solving the problem
of the detached shock wave .  if the shock wave is assumed
known, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differential
equations arises .  this has been solved by several authors
in the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of
the shock wave) .  considering the plane stationary case, the
author seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation
function (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real .
in the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies a
hyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave) .  a
new cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the original
problem obtained by analytic continuation .  a numerical

  a method is described for calculating examples of hypersonic

symmetric body .  the form of the shock wave is assumed, and the
analysis is based on a cauchy problem for the stream function
in the subsonic region, where the motion is governed by a
partial differential equation of elliptic type .  through analytic
continuation into the complex domain, the cauchy problem is
reformulated in such a manner that it becomes properly set in the
subsonic region .  this leads to a stable scheme for computation
of the flow by finite differences .  numerical examples at
freestream mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow is
determined throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, the
detachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and the
pressure distribution along the body are calculated .  these results are

shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry .
a study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flow
field develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re-
entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow
regime . the various types of flow regimes encountered down to low
altitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and
behavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed . it
is shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions
occur at a higher altitude than previously indicated . based on
available evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are
essentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes
 equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes
 except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height of
less than one factor of 10 in free stream density change . it is also
suggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs very
rapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the
transitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is
governed principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is
determined by a local mean free path .

the solution of small displacement, stability or vibration
problems concerning a flat rectangular panel when the

  this report describes an energy method for
the exact solution of problems concerning the small
displacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panel
when the edges are either clamped or simply supported .
the influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges,
and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel
so that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle
surface of the panel, is taken into account .  the method
is not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic
panels when the material of the panel has two directions
of elastic symmetry parallel to the edges .
  the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of
linear equations for small displacement problems or on
an infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration
problems .  the important feature of the analysis given is
that it enables a direct approach to be made to these equations
in any particular problem .  it is not in general possible
to obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it is
necessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linear
equations or a finite determinantal equation derived from the
more important terms in the analytical expression for the
transverse displacement of the panel .  here, physical intuition
and, if available, experimental data serve as a guide and
the accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the
rate of convergence with the increase in the number of
terms considered .
  the general method of solution is applied first to the free
vibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped,
and second to the buckling of a square panel under shear when
three edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported .

heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of
a body of revolution .
in order to determine the temperature distribution over a
body moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of the
local heat-transfer coefficients is required .  for slender
sharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently
approximated by using the comparable flat-plate values .
however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not
applicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rate
of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its
value should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solution
is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of
a body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed
flow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has
been given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body moving
with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of
the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speed
solution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center
of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .

stability of rectangular plates under shear and bending

  the author first discusses the problem of a plane, simply
supported rectangular plate loaded by shearing forces in
the plane of the plate on all four edges .  there are two
stiffeners attached one third and two thirds of the way
along the plate .  the critical load is calculated for various
stiffener rigidities .  also, the rigidity necessary to keep
the stiffeners straight when the plate buckles is found .
this stiffener rigidity is found to be slightly larger than
that necessary for a plate with one stiffener and the same
panel dimensions as the plate with two stiffeners .
  the second problem discussed by the author is that of a
plane, simply supported rectangular plate loaded by
uniformly distributed edge shearing forces in the plane of the
plate and linearly distributed tension and compression in
the plane of the plate at the ends .  the end forces vary
from tension, at one corner to, at the other corner,
so that their resultant is a bending moment .  the
presence of the edge shearing forces is found to diminish the
critical bending stress in this case .  calculations are made
for various magnitudes of bending and shearing forces for
plates of various proportions .

the buckling shear stress of simply-supported infinitely
long plates with transverse stiffeners .
  this report is an extension of previous theoretical
investigations of the elastic buckling in shear of flat
plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners . the plates are treated
as infinitely long and simply-supported along the long
sides . stiffeners are spaced at regular intervals, dividing the plate
into a number of panels of uniform size . the effect
ob bending and torsional stiffnesses of the stiffener upon the buckling
shear stress is calculated for the complete range
of stiffnesses, for panels with ratios of width to stiffener spacing of
graphical forms .
